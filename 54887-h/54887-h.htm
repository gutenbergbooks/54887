<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">"The</span> river is coming up at the rate of an
inch an hour!” announced Mr. Miller,
reading from the evening paper. “At one
o’clock it was eighteen feet, and reports from the
north indicate the highest water ever known on the
Upper Mississippi.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered Ned, who was sitting on the
porch steps, waiting for supper, and had heard
through the open window.</p>

<p>“Why, Ned!” rebuked his mother. “Think of
all the suffering this means!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, the river’s booming,” ventured
Ned, abashed. “It’s even with the railroad tracks.
I was down looking at it after school.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for the poor people on the flats&mdash;the
lowlands must be flooded,” continued Mrs. Miller.</p>

<p>“But they tie their houses to trees with ropes,
and move into the second stories, and go about on
rafts,” explained Ned, to whom such a plight was not
without fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Still, I fancy that these people don’t find their fix
very amusing, Ned,” commented his father. “Nor is
it humorous to the merchants to have their cellars
swamped and their goods damaged.”</p>

<p>Ned temporarily subsided&mdash;meekly convinced of
the serious phase of a freshet, but nevertheless seeing
sport in prospect.</p>

<p>“Say, father,” he blurted out, in the midst of supper,
“Hal&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Neddie! How often have I told you not to address
anybody with ‘say’?” interrupted his mother,
severely.</p>

<p>“Oh!” admitted Ned, guilt in his tones. Rallying
from the setback he resumed:</p>

<p>“I only wanted to ask if I couldn’t go over on
Eagle Island to-morrow with Hal, in our boat. It’s
all under water, and every one has moved off.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> have no special objection,” answered his father,
“if you’ll promise to be careful.”</p>

<p>“Neddie, <em>do</em> be careful,” implored his mother.
“You surely will, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” assured Ned. “But, pshaw, there
isn’t any danger. You couldn’t tip over the boat if
you tried!”</p>

<p>“However, I wouldn’t try, if I were you,” remarked
his father. Then he added, teasingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll let him have this Saturday for his fun,
Helen, and next Saturday he’ll have some wood to
pile! I’ve ordered eleven loads, and it will be hauled
during the week.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father! Eleven loads!” exclaimed Ned, in
dismay.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, dawned clear and soft, a
typical June morning. Ned turned out early, and
had most of his chores done before breakfast, despite
the fact that a double supply of wood was necessary
for the kitchen stove, in order to last over Sunday.</p>

<p>When, at eight o’clock, Hal Lucas whistled for
him, in front, he was ready to start. Stuffing his
lunch, wrapped in two packages, into his side coat-pockets,
he rushed through the house, kissing his
mother on his way, and out of the gate.</p>

<p>“Now, be careful, Ned!” called his mother, after
him.</p>

<p>“I will,” he shouted. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller stood on the porch, watching the two
boys as they merrily trudged off. Ned had many a
time asserted, with truth, that although he might go
upon the river every day for fifty years, each time
his mother would be worried about him until he
came home again. A mother’s heart is a very anxious
heart.</p>

<p>Ned and Hal hastened down the street. Ahead
of them they could see the river sparkling under the
rays of the sun. Ordinarily it was not visible from
this distance; but at present, far out of its bed, it was
right on a level with the railroad skirting it.</p>

<p>“My! She’s on a tear, isn’t she!” said Hal, enthusiastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“If ever she gets over the tracks she’ll come
whooping, my father says,” responded Ned. “She’s
higher than the street, now!”</p>

<p>Without question the river was, to use Hal’s expression,
“on a tear.” People along the Mississippi
expect, as a matter of course, high water in the spring
and early summer. Moderate high water is welcomed.
It enables the logging companies to float
their stranded logs; it washes clean the banks and
the lowlands, carrying away tons of stuff that otherwise
might breed illness; it is one of nature’s
thorough purifiers.</p>

<p>But here was a “June rise” with a vengeance.
Up in the northern pineries the heavy snows of the
past winter were melting all at once beneath long-continued
rains. Every stream was a torrent, pouring
its swollen tide into the Mississippi. As a
consequence of this hearty diet, the old Father of
Waters had increased his girth enormously. Never
was a prize grunter fattened so rapidly.</p>

<p>His bulk began to take up more room than was
comfortable for his neighbors. Some persons were
forced to flee for their lives; others were prepared to
leave their homes at a moment’s notice. Whole
towns were in danger of being flooded.</p>

<p>At Beaufort the sewers were being filled and the
water, creeping through them, flowed out far inland.
Cellars were being invaded; and seeping up, the
crafty flood inundated great tracts of street and yard
in the lower-lying resident portions of the town.</p>

<p>When, after school on the previous afternoon, Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
had gone down to look at the river, there had been
hardly any water inside the tracks at the foot of
Maple Street. But this morning the boys found
quite a pond had gathered during the night. In
places the board walks on either hand were afloat,
and children were running back and forth over them,
shouting with delight as the water spurted up between
the cracks.</p>

<p>“She’s soaking through,” commented Hal.</p>

<p>Ned nodded, and saying, “Come on,” deliberately
continued on the route, over the wavy, unsteady
walk. Hal followed. Both boys disdained to hurry
their pace one bit, even to avoid wet feet. They
deemed that a show of dignity was necessary, to impress
the scampering, screaming youngsters who were
spectators.</p>

<p>With a spring they leaped the open space between
the end of the walk and the railroad embankment.
Their feet sank deep into the mushy cinders as they
scrambled to the top.</p>

<p>This was four tracks wide, and usually was a good
stone’s throw from the river’s edge. To-day the
water was lapping at the rails. North and south
were scattered gangs of men with shovels, watching
to patch the slightest break. Seemingly the embankment
was all that kept the water from rushing
into the principal streets.</p>

<p>Ned and Hal stood and gazed in silent wonder at
the scene before them. The river was not that
friendly river to which they were accustomed. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was a sullen, menacing monster, without a single familiar
aspect. The water was an opaque, ugly yellow,
and was thickly charged with sediment. Extending
as far as eye could reach it swept past, bearing on
its mighty breast trunks of trees, pieces of lumber,
fragments of buildings, and not infrequently an entire
shed or small house.</p>

<p>There was no levee, no shore, no anything&mdash;save
water. The big Diamond Jo warehouse, with its
basement story completely submerged, was secured
by a hawser encircling it.</p>

<p>Commodore Jones’ little fish-market and boats-to-hire
establishment, a few rods below, also was anchored
by a rope. The water was within a couple
of inches of its platform; but nevertheless, river
threatening each moment to carry him away, here
sat the commodore, smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>The boys strolled to a point on the embankment
opposite him.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, commodore,” they called.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, young fellers,” responded the commodore.
“Better not come crost them planks,” he
admonished, indicating the narrow bridge which connected
his quarters with the land.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to,” replied Ned. “How’s the
water? Still rising?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the commodore. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>“She ain’t
raised any since midnight. I look for her to begin
to go down pretty soon, now. She’s fallin’ up
north.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the embankment will hold?”
asked Hal, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Certain, ’less we have an east wind,” assured the
commodore, between his puffs. “East wind would
pile up the waves an’ no knowin’ what would
happen.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll go out in our boat,” announced Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s there with them others under the lee
of the warehouse,” said the commodore, with a jerk
of his pipe toward the cluster of skiffs tied along the
embankment, in the angle formed by the end of the
steamboat building, and thus shielded from the current.
“Reckon I wouldn’t take no chances though,
if I was you. River’s full of drift-wood.”</p>

<p>The commodore was a stoical, gruff old veteran of
the Mississippi&mdash;whereby his title&mdash;and this advice
was no small concession.</p>

<p>“We’ll be careful,” cried Hal.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s safe enough,” grunted the commodore,
lapsing into the apparent surliness which covered a
really kind heart.</p>

<p>The boys proceeded to their boat, and unlocked
its painter from the larger chain to which all the
boats were fastened.</p>

<p>The craft of which they were joint owners was of
that type known on the Mississippi as scull-boat or
sink-boat. It was low and flat, with a smooth, dish-shaped
keel, sharp prow, and overhanging stern.
Its bows were decked, and a combing ran along the
gunwale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very convenient, reliable boat. Under the
decked bows could be stowed a surprising amount
of stuff. Being made from thin strips of cedar, it
was exceedingly buoyant and light; and in consequence
of its width and “flatness,” sitting as it did so
low in the water, capsizing was almost impossible.
As an extra precaution, however, Mr. Miller and Mr.
Lucas had caused air-cylinders of copper to be inserted,
inside the bows.</p>

<p>There were no seats or thwarts. The boys sprawled
about on the straw in the bottom. The one who
rowed sat on a soap-box; the one who sculled&mdash;for
in the stern was a hole for a sculling-oar&mdash;perched
on the gunwale.</p>

<p>You see, the boat was so steady that it did not
much matter how the persons in it acted.</p>

<p>Sometimes the boys rowed, sometimes they sculled,
and sometimes, if in a hurry or fought by a strong
current, they both rowed and sculled. When not
in use the boat was quartered with Commodore
Jones.</p>

<p>Hal jumped in, shipped the single pair of oars, and
then plumped into the stern; Ned shoved off, and
squatting on the soap-box applied himself to navigating,
for it happened to be his turn.</p>

<p>“Watch out for the lath!” cautioned Hal.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;I bet you it’s from the Beaufort Lumber
Company’s yards!” exclaimed Ned, twisting his
head to look over the bows.</p>

<p>Countless bunches of lath, extending up the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as far as the boys could see, were passing down in a
long, straight string. A few vigorous strokes with
the oars shot the boat out of the eddy formed by the
warehouse, and into the current, and carried them
through the line of lath. Now the craft was clear of
obstructions.</p>

<p>Eagle Island was a large tract of heavily wooded
land, reaching down river from off the lower end of
town. It was four miles in length, and half a mile or
more in breadth. Paper-mill Slough separated it
from the mainland. Quite a settlement of wood-choppers,
small farmers, and mill employees lived
upon it; and with its nuts, its fishing, and its other
attractions, it was a favorite resort for the Beaufort
youth.</p>

<p>The powerful current of the freshet swept the voyagers
rapidly onward. In a moment they had passed
under the bridge, against the piers of which the
water boiled and swirled. On the nearer shore they
caught a glimpse, here and there, of shanties held in
place by ropes, and of their tenants paddling about
the thresholds in skiffs. The river appeared to be
among the lumber piles of the Mosher Lumber Company,
even!</p>

<p>Of the farther shore nothing was to be seen. The
water stretched in this direction for miles and miles,
only a fringe of willows marking its ordinary
bounds.</p>

<p>And now they were beyond the lumber yards, and
had entered Paper-mill Slough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The head of Eagle Island was still high and dry,
above the reach of the flood. The current, split by
the promontory, was not so swift in the slough as in
the river proper.</p>

<p>The boys kept close to the island, and presently
the ground had so descended that the water was
rushing in among the trees.</p>

<p>“Where will we go in?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, anywhere,” replied Hal; adding: “Let’s go
in here.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you scull,” said Ned, dealing the boat
a sudden twist with the left-hand oar, and sending it
obliquely into the woods.</p>

<p>With a quick motion he unshipped the oars from
their locks and himself from the soap-box, and sitting
comfortably on the straw, his back against the half-deck
of the bows, he took it easy.</p>

<p>Between the hickories and the oaks glided the
nimble craft, the screw-like movement of the sculling
oar, deftly managed by Hal, giving it an agreeable
wriggling, rocking motion.</p>

<p>The water varied in depth. In some places the
oar-blade touched bottom; again no bottom was to
be found. Above the surface in the shallows the
tops of weeds and bushes swayed with the current.
Not a sound of human life was heard. The only
noises to break the silence were the twitterings of
uneasy birds amidst the branches of the trees, and
once in a while a slight scrape from the boat’s
prow as Hal steered through a narrow channel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an enchanted island, spellbound by the
freshet.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it seem queer, though!” commented
Ned, after they had gone a short distance, upon a
zigzag course.</p>

<p>“I should say!” agreed Hal, letting the boat drift,
and with eyes and ears drinking in the novelty of it
all. “Where will we make for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” responded Ned. “See! there’s a
barn.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, directly ahead was a small, unpainted,
weather-beaten barn just visible between the
tree-trunks. Hal began to scull gently, and as they
drew nearer they saw a house, also, not far from it.</p>

<p>The scene was rather pathetic&mdash;this home, lonely
and deserted, standing waist-deep in the midst of the
waters, its only companions the silent forest trees.</p>

<p>“The folks who lived here must have skipped in a
big hurry,” observed Ned. “They didn’t even stop
to close their up-stairs windows.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s the way they got out,” suggested
Hal.</p>

<p>“I hear a dog!” suddenly Ned exclaimed.</p>

<p>“He’s shut in the house,” said Hal, poising his
oar and listening.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow! He’s around somewhere, that’s
sure,” agreed Ned. “Let’s go nearer and see about
him.”</p>

<p>With the howling of the dog to urge them,
they sculled forward. First in their path was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
barn; and with a change in their angle of view Ned
cried:</p>

<p>“There he is! He’s in the loft!”</p>

<p>True enough. In the square doorway of the barn-loft
was a medium size brown dog, peering out to
catch their coming. Evidently he had heard their
voices, and had howled for help.</p>

<p>“Now, I call that a shame!” declared Ned.</p>

<p>The dog howled back that indeed it was.</p>

<p>“Let’s rescue him,” proposed Hal, laying hold of
a sapling, to keep the boat where the dog might see
them, while they discussed him. “Why, he must be
half starved!”</p>

<p>“Unless the family left him on purpose, and put
some stuff in there for him to eat,” hazarded Ned.</p>

<p>“Then he ate it all up at once&mdash;dogs never save,
like a cat,” rejoined Hal, sagely. “Besides, I don’t
believe his folks did that&mdash;they simply deserted him,
because they were scared.”</p>

<p>“But how can we get at him?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>Hal released his hold on the sapling, and sculled
across to the barn. The dog, seeing them move
toward him, whined frantically, and craned his neck
to watch them.</p>

<p>They rasped along the gray boards of the barn
until they came to a door, the upper half of which
was out of water.</p>

<p>“See if you can open it,” said Hal. “Perhaps we
can go in with the boat, to the stairs.”</p>

<p>“Padlocked,” informed Ned, briefly, and in disgust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
“That proves it! They left him here on
purpose.”</p>

<p>“No, sir-ee!” Hal insisted. “They never thought
of the barn&mdash;they skipped after it had been locked
for the night.”</p>

<p>They made a circuit of the barn, but there was no
other door; and although within easy reach there
was a window, of dirty panes, it was quite too narrow
for entrance. Besides, the water hereabouts was five
feet deep, as Ned found by sounding with an oar,
and there was no knowing what disagreeable surprise
the inside of the barn might offer to a person dropping
through the window.</p>

<p>He peered through the dingy glass, and as well as
he could scanned the dim, shadowy interior, faintly
shown by the light which penetrated between the
boards.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m glad a horse or cow isn’t in there,”
he said.</p>

<p>They had passed out of the dog’s sight, and he was
howling piteously, thinking that he had lost them.</p>

<p>“We’re coming,” shouted Ned; and they hastened
to station themselves again at the sapling where the
dog could see them.</p>

<p>This comforted him, and his howling changed to
whines of greeting.</p>

<p>“Poor doggie,” spoke Hal to him. “I wish we
could help you out of your fix.”</p>

<p>“Jump,” called Ned.</p>

<p>The two boys tried in vain by coaxing and commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to make the dog jump from the window.
It was only about eight feet to the surface of the
water, and although he seemed to know just what
they wanted, he could not muster spunk for the
leap. He barked and whined, and crouched and
stretched, one end willing but the other end afraid;
and on the very brink he always balked.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Hal, finally, “I don’t see what
we can do&mdash;we can’t get up there, and you won’t
come down here. So we’ll have to leave you. I
hope somebody will come after you pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great big shame, that’s what it is!” declared
Ned. “We’ll bring you over some meat,
won’t we, Hal!”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered Hal, seizing upon the
idea.</p>

<p>“One thing is sure&mdash;he won’t die from thirst!”
said Ned, looking back regretfully, as they slowly
sculled off.</p>

<p>The dog, seeing them go, lifted his nose and
howled as if his heart was breaking.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Hal. “He thinks we’re
leaving him for good.”</p>

<p>“He’s going to jump! He’s going to jump!”
cried Ned, suddenly. “Whistle!”</p>

<p>Yes, the dog was nerving himself to the feat. In
desperation he fidgeted from side to side of the doorway,
craning, running back and forth, and acting like
a dog possessed.</p>

<p>The combined whistle of the boys was too much!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look!” shouted both at once.</p>

<p>With a last howl he was in mid-air, his legs outspread;
and in a twinkling he had disappeared, amid
a mighty splash, beneath the water.</p>

<p>“My&mdash;that must have hurt his stomach like
sixty!” laughed Hal.</p>

<p>But the dog seemed not hurt a particle. In a moment,
above the surface popped his head, and shaking
it vigorously to clear his eyes and ears of water,
yapping with eagerness and excitement he lined a
course straight for the boat.</p>

<p>“Come on, come on, old fellow!” urged the boys.</p>

<p>“Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!” said the dog.</p>

<p>And come he did, as fast as his legs and paws
could send him, his chest cleaving the ripples, and a
bubbly wake extending far behind him.</p>

<p>Speedily he had gained the boat, and Ned had
pulled him in. Convinced that now he was saved,
the dog went into perfect transports of happiness.
He barked, he yelped, he whined, he snickered, he
twisted his body into knots; he talked to one boy,
and then to the other, and then to the two at once,
telling them all about it; he flicked water over them
with his whipping tail, and shaking himself doused
them again until they were well-nigh as wet as he.
And how he grinned!</p>

<p>“He’s laughing!” cried Hal.</p>

<p>Indeed, this was true. The pendant upper lip of
the dog was wrinkled back, so that he was showing
his white teeth in a ridiculous grin!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well!” remarked Ned, staring at him. “It
doesn’t make him look very pretty, anyway.”</p>

<p>Which, also, was true, for the grin was like a
snarl.</p>

<p>The dog, having paid his respects, cuddled himself
on the straw of the bows, in the sun, and there
blinked, now and then expressing his ecstasy by a
contented little sigh.</p>

<p>“He knows we’ve got to keep him,” declared Hal.
“We can’t throw him up into the loft again, and
there’s no other place for him, except the boat.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it, too,” asserted Ned. “Those people
don’t deserve a dog, after the way they’ve treated
him! Do they, pup?”</p>

<p>The dog, hearing himself addressed, whimpered as
if in memory of a dark past, and at the same time
thumped his tail in celebration of a bright present.</p>

<p>“But maybe we’ll have to return him,” prophesied
Hal, mechanically working the sculling oar. “He’s
a pointer, and perhaps he’s valuable.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose we can find the house again?”
mused Ned.</p>

<p>“Our folks might make us try,” replied Hal.
“Let’s scull away as hard as we can, without looking
where we’re going. Then we’ll lose it.”</p>

<p>Acting upon his own suggestion Hall sculled
stoutly, skimming aimlessly between the trees, and
soon the house and barn were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“There!” he panted, ceasing his exertions, and
letting the boat drift. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>“Now where are we?”</p>

<p>“I give it up,” candidly confessed Ned. “The
water changes everything so. But what’s the matter
with eating? Aren’t you hungry?”</p>

<p>“Hungry!” exclaimed Hal. “You watch me.”</p>

<p>As the boys untied their packages of lunch the
dog sat up in expectation. He was all eyes and
mouth.</p>

<p>“He’s hungry, too,” declared Hal. “He heard us
say ‘eat.’ Here&mdash;catch!”</p>

<p>He tossed a slice of bread at their canine charge,
and down it went, apparently swallowed whole.</p>

<p>The lunch which had been intended for two did
for three; the boys munched and the dog gobbled,
and presently scarcely a crumb remained.</p>

<p>During this time the boat had been carried by the
current, bumping into tree-trunks, and swinging to
right and to left, with weeds and bushes scraping
along its bottom and against its sides.</p>

<p>The boys lolled on the warm straw, and the dog,
no doubt exhausted by his vigils in the barn-loft,
went to sleep.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant, thus to float through the
green woods, over ground which they so often had
traversed afoot. Occasionally they saw other houses
and barns, flooded and lifeless, and in all respects
appearing much the same as the place at which the
pointer had been discovered.</p>

<p>“Well, if the dog can go there again, all right,”
murmured Hal. “<em>I</em> can’t.”</p>

<p>“I either,” declared Ned, drowsily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the boat emerged into an open area,
with only pond-lily pads and buds breaking the
ripples.</p>

<p>“Hello!” spoke Hal. “This must be Beaver
Lake, Ned.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” agreed Ned. “I believe we ought to
turn back and strike for home, if we want to take
things easy. If we go any farther we’ll have an
awful job getting back.”</p>

<p>He seized the sculling oar, and swinging the craft
around headed into the trees again.</p>

<p>“I’ll scull,” he said, “and when we reach the
slough you can row.”</p>

<p>The return progress was slower, for the current
was against them. Whenever Hal could help with
the oars, he did, but at many points there was not
room to use them. However, the current, while
hindering, also served as a guide.</p>

<p>“The river’s falling!” suddenly cried Hal, pointing
to a tree-trunk close at hand. “See there!”</p>

<p>A narrow margin of wet, marking where the water
must have been, was visible on the bark, above the
smooth tide.</p>

<p>“And there’s some mud!” he triumphantly
added, at a strip of ooze from which the water had
receded.</p>

<p>“Humph!” commented Ned; whether from pleasure
or disappointment, was not clear.</p>

<p>Yes, the crest of the freshet had passed. Upon
every tree within sight was the unmistakable sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>But the dog in the bows of the boat slept on. He
was not interested; for all he cared the flood might
last forever. He was beyond its clutches.</p>

<p>The trip home was achieved by dint of incessant
tugging and pulling. The boys crossed the slough,
and then worked their way along the shore, where
the current was not so fierce. Finally, with blistered
hands and numb wrists they glided in behind the
warehouse, whence they had started.</p>

<p>The dog, overjoyed, jumped out first; with a grunt
of relief, they followed.</p>

<p>“Back, are you?” greeted Commodore Jones (who
sat just as they had left him) when they approached
with the oars.</p>

<p>“See what we found,” bade Ned, nodding toward
the dog.</p>

<p>“Pointer pup, eh?” said the commodore.
“Where’d you get him?”</p>

<p>“Somebody had left him in a barn half under
water,” informed Hal; “on Eagle.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” responded the commodore,
pityingly. “Sech a man ain’t fit to have a dog.
You’d better keep him.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to,” answered the boys, in unison.</p>

<p>“What will we do about him?” asked Ned, as
they were walking homeward. “Shall we draw lots
to see which’ll take him?”</p>

<p>“N-n-no,” responded Hal, reluctantly. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>“You can
have him. My mother says she won’t allow a dog
about, or else I’d have had one long ago.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” sympathized Ned. “At our
house we all like dogs&mdash;at least, mother does if they
don’t dig up her flowers.”</p>

<p>“You ought to call him Robinson Crusoe&mdash;Crusoe
was wrecked on an island, you know,” suggested
Hal.</p>

<p>“Or ‘Bob’ for short,” cried Ned, the idea appealing
to him. “All right&mdash;you name him and I’ll have
him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” admitted Hal, ruefully.</p>

<p>When they parted at the street corner, the dog
hesitated, uncertain which to accompany.</p>

<p>“Come on, Bob,” called Ned.</p>

<p>And Bob, quickly deciding, followed him.</p>

<span class = "small">THE GREAT LUMBER FIRE</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">The</span> river went down as rapidly as it had
come up, but left upon the clap-boards of the
Diamond Jo warehouse a line of mud in
token of its visit. People in the low-lying portions
of the city hastened to move back into their accustomed
quarters, now soaked by the flood. Many a
cellar was pumped out. And at the levee Commodore
Jones’ flock of skiffs was once more tethered in
its usual place before the little boat-house.</p>

<p>Much to Ned’s disgust the eleven loads of wood
arrived promptly at the Miller premises&mdash;eleven great
loads of wet slabs, making a mountain higher than
the alley fence, and filling all the space between the
wood-shed and the next back-yard!</p>

<p>These slabs were to be loosely laid, one upon another,
in long, parallel piles, so that the air could
circulate freely between them. When the wood had
dried, it was to be split, and put in the shed, for use.</p>

<p>It seemed to Ned an endless task, to dispose of
such a mass, stick by stick. However, he had
accomplished it in previous summers, and although
each June it loomed into sight afresh, yet somehow
by pegging away he managed to struggle through it.</p>

<p>Having for several days dolefully eyed the mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
on the morning of the Saturday succeeding the
Bob rescue he began, with a groan, the base of his
first pile. But he knew that groaning was of no use;
he was expected to devote this Saturday morning,
and the next Saturday morning, and two hours a day
during the coming long vacation, to the work until it
was finished.</p>

<p>Bob, having industriously trotted hither and thither
through the yard, and having gazed right and left
along the street, in search for amusement, came and
sat on his haunches near Ned, and with a puzzled,
wondering expression, surveyed his movements.</p>

<p>A week had effected quite a change in Bob’s appearance.
The warm welcome which he had
received at the Miller home, and the food and petting
which he was being accorded, already had slicked his
coat, and covered his ribs. That confidence in
humanity which he had lost while confined in the
barn on Eagle Island, now had returned to him. He
was a very happy dog.</p>

<p>For a few moments he watched Ned intently.
Presently, getting no encouragement to frolic, and
doubtless disgusted that upon such a bright morning
his master should be given to so stupid an employment,
he curled up in the sun, against the wood-shed,
and fitfully dozed&mdash;one eye at a time, in order that
he might be on the alert, should something happen.</p>

<p>And something did happen!</p>

<p>Bob had been napping for but half an hour when
suddenly the unearthly shriek of the fire-whistle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
pierced the still air. The Beaufort fire-whistle was a
most appalling sound&mdash;running up and down the
scales, at one instant a shrill tremulo, at another a
deep bass. Under favorable conditions it could be
heard, folks claimed, fifteen miles!</p>

<p>With the first note Ned poised in his hands the
slab which he was transferring from heap to pile, and
waited, breathless, to see whether it was the water-works’
alarm, or only a steamboat. With the second
he dropped his slab, and straightened. Yes, indeed,
it was the fire-whistle! Bob lifted his nose, and
howled vigorously. This was the influence of the
whistle upon all dogs within ear-shot: it made them
howl and howl, but nobody knew why.</p>

<p>Ned scanned the horizon. In the southeast, topping
the maples which bordered either side of the
street, he caught a glimpse of a huge cloud of black
smoke, sluggishly unfolding and spreading.</p>

<p>The spectacle electrified him. In a second he and
Bob were rushing wildly through the yard, and out
of the front gate.</p>

<p>“It’s the lumber yards&mdash;it’s Mosher’s lumber
yards!” he cried, to his mother, who was standing,
anxious-faced, on the porch.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>No more wood piling on <em>that</em> day!</p>

<p>The pretty, modest resident street was all astir.
Heads popped from windows, voices called and
answered, and young and old hastened upon walk or
horse-block, or into the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s Mosher’s lumber yards!” was repeated, from
lot to lot, and from corner to corner.</p>

<p>The bell of the Congregational church pealed forth
its clamorous warning.</p>

<p>Two streams of people were set in motion&mdash;the one
flowing tumultuously toward the cloud of smoke, the
other speeding frantically for the nearest hose house,
headquarters of the Pole Star Volunteers.</p>

<p>Ned, with Bob barking and leaping about him, fell
in with the latter current. Very soon, you may be
sure, he arrived at the hose house. He found a
large throng of men and boys collected before the
door.</p>

<p>“Where’s the key? They can’t find the key!” he
heard announced from every side.</p>

<p>The town marshal mounted the steps of the outside
stairs, so that he could look over the crowd.</p>

<p>“Does any one know where the key is?” he bellowed,
searching the faces of the jostling mob which,
brimming with excitement, was constantly increasing.</p>

<p>“Where’s the key? Who knows where the key
is?” echoed the people, to each other, screaming the
query as loud as they could.</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;it’s hanging behind the door in Fleischmann’s
grocery!” volunteered a youngster of ten
years, barefooted, in faded blue overalls and dingy
checked waist. And off he scurried, importance
showing in every flap of his overalls against his bare
ankles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s in Fleischmann’s grocery&mdash;the boy’s gone to
get it,” volleyed a chorus, to the marshal.</p>

<p>“Here it comes!” was shouted, in a moment.
“Let the lad through&mdash;you fellows out there!”</p>

<p>A dozen hands reached to grasp the urchin by the
shirt and pull him ahead.</p>

<p>“Pass up the key,” ordered the marshal.</p>

<p>“But I ain’t got it&mdash;it wasn’t there,” explained the
boy, as rapidly as he could. “They said they didn’t
have it any more!”</p>

<p>“Sold it for old iron, I bet you,” remarked a joker.
His hearers laughed, and as this hit at Fleischmann
went from mouth to mouth guffaws went, too.</p>

<p>“Break in the door! Bust the padlock!” suggested
a stout, white-aproned man&mdash;Schmidt, the
butcher.</p>

<p>“Smash a window and climb in,” suggested somebody
else.</p>

<p>“What good would <em>that</em> do?” inquired Mr.
Schmidt, scornfully.</p>

<p>“Here’s the key&mdash;here’s the key!” arose the cry,
and the throng eddied and swirled as a man elbowed
his path through to the door, and applied a key to
the lock.</p>

<p>The crowd pressed forward when, with an impatient
motion, the man jerked open the padlock, and
hurled aside the sliding door. So many zealous helpers
offered themselves that much confusion resulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Keep out! Keep out! Hang it all, give us
room!”</p>

<p>The mass upon the threshold separated violently to
right and left, and out from the dim, cool interior
(smelling strongly of damp rubber) was rolled the
cart, guided by every person who could lay finger
upon it.</p>

<p>Ere it had fairly emerged additional hands fought
for the privilege of grasping the ropes attached to it.
Shoved and buffeted and trod upon, Ned squirmed
into the thick of the struggle, and was rewarded by
feeling his fingers close upon a rope. But what was
his position he did not know.</p>

<p>Now the cart burst away from the mob, and into
the street. With a whoop and a hurrah, clangor of
gong and tooting of trumpet, up the thoroughfare it
trundled, drawn by two long lines of people&mdash;youth
and age yoked in a common cause. Those unlucky
and envious people who, owing to lack of space, were
denied a place in the team, valiantly formed a running
escort.</p>

<p>As it happened, Ned had been particularly favored
when he had grabbed the rope, for his place was just
behind the leader. This leader was “Sandy” Baxter,
Beaufort’s foot-racer. He headed the two lines,
and set the pace; next came Ned, on the right, and
Tom Walker, the attorney, on the left. Who followed,
Ned did not have time to see. He had all he
could do to hold his own, and not prove a drag.
However, hold it he did, for he was the best runner
among all the boys of his neighborhood, and he had
a reputation to sustain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Furthermore, plain in view, straight down the
street, was that ominous volume of smoke, ever swelling,
like the terrible breath of a volcano. Wasn’t
that enough to spur <em>any</em> boy’s legs? Certainly!</p>

<p>“Sandy” seemed not to care whether or not his
team-mates could keep up with him. He started in
at a tremendous gait, and he did not abate it in the
slightest. He had no mercy. The lumber yards
were burning!</p>

<p>Along the ropes short-winded persons began to
fall out; some, grown clumsy through their exertions,
stumbled on the heels of their file-leaders, thus
promoting disorder and profanity.</p>

<p>“Spurt her up! All together!” urged the marshal,
amid the lines.</p>

<p>“Hurroo! Hurroo!” responded his associates,
with failing, husky voices.</p>

<p>A loosened tire of the cart rattled loudly.</p>

<p>“Clang!” sounded the rusty, cracked gong, at
every turn of the wheels.</p>

<p>“Bow wow! Wow, wow, wow!” yelped Bob and
several other canine enthusiasts, outstripping, now
and then, the whole crew, and halting, with lolling
tongue, for it to catch up.</p>

<p>The cart had been hauled, in this manner, three
blocks, when on a sudden an empty lumber-wagon
dashed athwart its course, and came sharply to a
standstill.</p>

<p>“Pass the ropes aboard, boys,” commanded the
marshal. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>“Quick!”</p>

<p>The ropes were thrown into the wagon-box, were
rudely fastened, the marshal and “Sandy” Baxter
clambered in to watch them. “All right!” called a
score of voices; the driver leaned forward from his
seat and lashed his steeds, and very nearly before the
cart had stopped it was once more upon its way, this
time attached to the jolting, swaying wagon drawn
at a gallop by the heavy horses.</p>

<p>The folk whose occupation had thus been taken
from them pursued as best they might.</p>

<p>Ned, panting but determined, lustily labored on in
the wake of the cart, Bob loping beside him. The
smoke cloud waxed larger and larger. They could
see an immense swarm of people collected apparently
beneath it, and could hear a medley, now faint, now
quite distinct, of shouts and cries.</p>

<p>The Congregational church bell was ringing without
stop&mdash;just as if by this time all Beaufort was not
thoroughly aroused and bound, helter-skelter, for the
scene!</p>

<p>Five minutes more, and&mdash;</p>

<p>“Gee-<em>whiz!</em>” gasped Ned, transfixed with amazement.</p>

<p>He had reached his goal. Immediately before
him lay the lumber yards. Over them rested that
black canopy which had been visible from afar, and
which, from a-near, was seen to be licked by leaping
flames. The air was pungent with the odor of
scorched pine. On this side of the railroad tracks
which skirted the yards, at the north, were the onlookers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
men, women and children&mdash;packing every
vacant spot, occupying every point of vantage. Beyond
the tracks, among the very piles, were the fire-fighters,
like groups of pigmies attacking a blaze-vomiting
giant.</p>

<p>Above the feverish cries of the spectators, above
the hoarse shouts of the firemen, sounded the crackle
and roar of the conflagration.</p>

<p>The entire district south of the tracks seemed
doomed to be wiped out. Here, in the Mosher
yards, were thousands upon thousands of feet of dry
lumber. The fire fairly flew from pile to pile, and so
intense was the heat that the pitchy material appeared
to break into flames all at once, from within.</p>

<p>East of the yards was the river; but west was that
section of the town known as South Beaufort, made
up, mostly, of the homes of mill men and railroad
men. Fine opportunity did these houses, close together
and lightly constructed, offer to the fire!</p>

<p>At the outset little wind had been blowing; but
the fire was creating a draft, forming a vortex into
which poured the cool air in a regular gale. Enormous
cinders whirled high aloft, to stream down
everywhere. The whole town was endangered by
them.</p>

<p>“Here comes Hal,” knocked Bob with his tail
against his master’s leg.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob,” called Hal, who was making for
them through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hal, isn’t this awful!” greeted Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say so!” replied Hal. “Let’s climb
up on top of those box-cars, where we can see
better.”</p>

<p>So they dodged over to some box-cars standing
on the tracks which branched northward, along the
river, and secured seats from which they had a view
unobstructed by irritating heads and hats. Other
persons had preceded them, but there was plenty of
room, and dangling their feet down the end of a
car they proceeded to watch and wait. Bob, after a
number of fruitless efforts to scale the side of the car,
sat on the ground and watched and waited, too.
However, he was interested in the two boys, more
than in the fire.</p>

<p>“There’s just dray-load after dray-load of goods
being hauled out of South Beaufort,” said Hal. “I
was over a while. The people are scared, I tell
you!”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and help,” suggested Ned, stung by the
idea.</p>

<p>“No use,” responded Hal. “They can’t get
wagons enough, for love or money, to take what
stuff is scattered round, already.”</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;if the fire ever gets into South Beaufort, it
will cross the tracks, sure, and then&mdash;um-m-m!” exclaimed
Ned, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Then the whole town will burn!” faltered Hal,
his face paling.</p>

<p>At this instant they perceived among the throng
which they had just left a bustle of excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Then came to their ears a cheer, and another, and
another; then a continuous uproar.</p>

<p>Everybody upon the box-cars stood up to peer
and wonder.</p>

<p>“It’s the fire department from Sundale! See!
Hurrah! Hurrah!” shouted Hal, swinging his hat.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” chimed in Ned, and all the others.</p>

<p>Sundale was the neighboring village&mdash;a rival save
in time of need like this&mdash;two miles northward.
Down the street, nearer and nearer, welcomed by
cheer after cheer, came the two carts, their plunging
horses, foam-flecked by their long run, exerting their
last energy in one final spurt; down, down, “clang!
clang! clang!” straight through the living lane and
across the tracks. Hurrah!</p>

<p>“Bully for Sundale!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“You bet!” agreed Hal; and none disputed.</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll do some good,” he added. “But,
oh, look at it now, will you!”</p>

<p>The sight was superb, but it was frightful. Even
during the short time that the boys had been on the
car the fire had increased shockingly. It did not
seem to jump from the top of one pile to another,
but it seemed to devour entire piles at a gulp.
Piles fifty, seventy, ninety feet high disappeared
in a twinkling. Their boards curled and withered
like leaves, as the fury of the fiery blast sucked
them in.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of standing off and squirting at
it!” grumbled Ned. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>“They aren’t stopping it!”</p>

<p>“And they can’t get close enough to reach it&mdash;and
if they could the water would turn to steam before
it struck!” said Hal. “I&mdash;I guess I ought to
go home, Ned.”</p>

<p>He was almost crying, and his voice ended in a
despairing little wail. Ned, too, felt a queer thrill of
helplessness; but he answered, stoutly:</p>

<p>“Pshaw, Hal; they’ll stop it some way. They
must, you know.”</p>

<p>“But Chicago burned up, Ned,” quavered Hal.
“<em>You</em> needn’t go&mdash;your house wouldn’t burn until
after ours. So you can stay, if you want to. My
mother is scared to death&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Boom!”</p>

<p>“Listen! What is that?” interrupted Ned.</p>

<p>“Boom!”</p>

<p>“They’re blowing up the piles with dynamite!”
asserted Ned, exultantly. “There’s another!”</p>

<p>“Do you think that will help?” queried Hal,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course,” assured Ned. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>“It’s the only way.
It will keep the fire from spreading, and make it
burn down low where they can put it out with
the hose. See? They’re blowing up the piles on
the South Beaufort side. Then if they stop the
fire from getting past the open space they’ve got
it! Who cares for the lumber, so long as the houses
don’t catch! And it can’t come this way, for the
tracks are too wide, here, and south of it they can
blow up more piles and stop it.”</p>

<p>Ned’s tones were so confident that Hal brightened,
and said nothing farther about leaving.</p>

<p>Besides, new distractions occurred. Over the railroad
bridge thundered a locomotive, twitching behind
it a single flat car, and whistling long and shrill.</p>

<p>“Hartville! It’s from Hartville!” flew the report.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Hartville!” cheered the spectators,
the thousand voices drowning the shrieks of the
proud engine.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Ned. “People in the other
towns must think we’re all burned.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it fine in them to send help!” exclaimed
Hal.</p>

<p>“We’d do as much for them,” responded Ned.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Hartville men arrived, when from
up the river echoed the deep, excited whistle of a
steamboat. The crowd turned its faces that way.</p>

<p>“It’s the ferry <em>Lady Rose</em>. She’s bringing the
Lynnton department!” exclaimed Hal.</p>

<p>Down swept the ferry, the black smoke streaming
from her stacks and trailing behind her in two tossing,
ever-expanding plumes; her side-wheels turning at a
prodigious rate; and her deck alive with people who
answered cheer with cheer.</p>

<p>The <cite>Lady Rose</cite> effected a hasty landing just above
the bridge, and her passengers, fire-laddies and spectators,
tumbled ashore. Then followed two hose-carts;
and right on the heels of the men from Hartville
followed the men from Lynnton, to help save
the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>But although the assistance was welcome, now, at
last, the tide had been stemmed. A wide line of
lumber piles had been leveled, cutting off the flames
in their mad career. A little wind set in from the
west, driving the fire back toward the river. With
hope renewed the firemen stubbornly stood their
ground, arrayed between the angry blaze and the
homes cowering just beyond.</p>

<p>And now the gallons of water being poured into
the fire commenced to have an effect. Coals sizzled
and blackened. Embers smouldered and died.
Aided by the good wind, step by step the firemen
advanced.</p>

<p>The day was won.</p>

<p>The fire lessened in volume; and seeing that the
danger was past, the people who had watched began
to slip away.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Ned, at last. “We might as
well go. It’s about over.”</p>

<p>They dropped off the car, and Bob, who had
deemed the fire a very dull affair (for a dog) welcomed
them loudly.</p>

<p>“My, I’m hungry!” declared Hal. “I wonder
what time it is.”</p>

<p>Whereupon they found that it was half-past one;
much after dinner time.</p>

<span class = "small">THE BREAK-WATER ACCIDENT</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Although</span> it had been subdued, and was
deprived of its fangs, the fire continued to
burn for several days. It burrowed deep into
the sawdust, and lurked amid the great masses of
black rubbish where once had been lumber and lath,
as if loth to leave its mangled prey.</p>

<p>The out-of-town firemen returned home that
evening, but all that night, and up to the middle of
the next week, the Beaufort department kept streams
playing upon the smoking ruins.</p>

<p>For a time these sorry-looking yards were regarded
by Bob and Ned and other Beaufort youth as
a very entertaining place. It was fun to explore the
desolate area, and conjecture what had been on this
spot, and what on that. No small spice of danger,
too, was offered by the tempting, swaying run-ways
and crumbling piles. But at length the sport palled,
and the Beaufort boys sought elsewhere for amusement
and occupation.</p>

<p>In regard to occupation, Ned did not have to seek
far. At his back door-step were those eleven loads
of wood. One Saturday had come and gone, and
scarcely an impression had been made upon the grim
mountain of slabs. This was the last week of school;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
another Saturday, and then he must pile every day
until he had performed his duty. That done he
would be free to do about as he pleased.</p>

<p>Could wishing have availed, those slabs would have
been in Halifax very soon, consigned there by Ned.
But of course Mr. Miller would have promptly ordered
eleven more loads, and since in Beaufort were
several lumber yards to draw upon, Ned’s case, even
were Halifax to aid him, was hopeless.</p>

<p>He did what any sensible boy would have done;
he pitched into the wood, working after school and
all day Saturday, and by the opening of the vacation
he had dug a great cave in the flank of the mountain.
Like the majority of tasks, this one, when stoutly
tackled, was not so big as it had appeared.</p>

<p>In regard to the amusement, this never could be
lacking while the river flowed past the town. The
warm rains and sun of the spring had taken the chill
from the water, and had made it almost comfortable
for swimming, when down had rushed the freshet,
with its icy flood of melted snow, and had spoiled
matters. Now the Mississippi was again at its ordinary
level, and under the influence of the summer
weather was rapidly assuming an agreeable temperature.</p>

<p>By the wireless telegraphy of boyhood the news
that there was “good swimming” traversed Beaufort
from end to end.</p>

<p>Ned, who had been fuming all the spring because
his father had refused to let him go in until the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was warmer, and thus had deprived him of the glory
of being among the first, received the tidings with rejoicing.
Surely, June was not too early for bathing!</p>

<p>Bob was more callous about the news. You see,
already he had indulged in a number of plunges, not
to speak of the dive from the barn window; therefore
his enthusiasm had cooled.</p>

<p>“Can’t I go swimming now, father?” begged
Ned, immediately upon hearing the reports. “All the
fellows have been in and they say the water is just as
warm as milk! If you’d only stick your hand in it
you’d see, yourself.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had much of a chance to ‘stick my
hand in it,’ yet, considering that my arm isn’t four
blocks long&mdash;and that is the nearest I have been to
the river, lately,” replied Mr. Miller, laughing.
“But if ‘all the fellows’ say so, it must be true.”</p>

<p>“Hal’s father has let <em>him</em> go,” argued Ned,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’ve nothing to do with Mr. Lucas’s notions&mdash;nor
have they anything to do with me, Ned,” responded
Mr. Miller. “The Miller affairs give me all
that I can attend to. However, I guess, if you’ll be
careful and not stay in too long, you can go ahead.”</p>

<p>“And don’t get in where it’s deep,” cautioned
Mrs. Miller.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, mother!” replied Ned. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>“Six feet is
as bad as a mile&mdash;and it’s easier swimming where it’s
real deep, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hate to have you go,” said his mother,
stroking his hair. “You promise to be very careful,
won’t you, and not bathe so often or stay in so long
that it makes you weak, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother. Don’t you be afraid,” he answered,
giving her a hearty hug.</p>

<p>“And don’t neglect that wood,” suggested his
father, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“That’s for mornings; I have my afternoons ‘off,’”
called back Ned, capering out of the house. In a
second he stuck his head in through a window and
cried: “I nearly forgot to say ‘thank you,’ father,
didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“I believe you did, Ned,” assured his father; and
Ned vanished.</p>

<p>“I really don’t see how it is possible that the
water should be warm, so soon,” declared Mrs. Miller,
anxiously, to her husband.</p>

<p>“I, either,” he replied, smiling. “But Ned can
stand it if the other boys can. It won’t hurt him
any.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” assented Mrs. Miller, doubtfully.</p>

<p>Well, to tell the fact, the water was <em>not</em> especially
warm, in spite of what “all the fellows” had declared.
It was as warm as milk&mdash;but that must have
referred to old milk, not fresh; perhaps milk which
had been in an ice-box.</p>

<p>At least, so Ned thought, when gingerly he started
to wade out, for the first swim of the season. He
stepped in, ankle-deep&mdash;and his toes curled, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
knees shook, and with a hasty exclamation he sprang
back.</p>

<p>“Oh, jump in all at once!” urged Hal. “’Tisn’t
cold; it’s fine,” and he paddled around to show his
perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>Ned was disappointed. When, on the way over in
the boat, they had dabbled with their fingers, to test,
the water had seemed just right; but now&mdash;ugh!</p>

<p>He tried again, and waded manfully until in above
his knees; here he faltered. The other boys, who
had been through the ordeal and were happy, began
to splash him with chilling drops, so that his naked
body shrank, and he shivered and begged.</p>

<p>“I’m coming! I’m coming!” he chattered.
“Only let me be, a minute.”</p>

<p>“Then wet over or we’ll douse you!” threatened
his persecutors, menacing him, in a half-circle.</p>

<p>“I will! I will! Quit! Don’t you see I am?”
implored Ned, wading a little farther. “Gimme a
chance to wet my head so I won’t have cramp, can’t
you?”</p>

<p>He stopped, and raising water in his hands dabbled
it upon his chest and back and hair, trying to
get used by degrees to the change. To his fingers
the goose-flesh on him felt like stubble!</p>

<p>Bob, joining forces with the other scoffing spectators,
raced along the shallows of the beach, barking
his derision. Great cats! what a silly boy! <em>He</em> had
been in and out of the water a dozen times.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned drew a big breath, shut his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and ducked under, sousing himself completely. He
emerged choking, staggering, gasping, while his companions,
tickled into spasms of merriment, wallowed
and shrieked.</p>

<p>But Ned minded not; the worst was past. He
boldly lunged ahead for a swim, and the water was
not a bit cold.</p>

<p>Beaufort bathers had choice of three favorite resorts.
First, there were the rafts, brought down by
the steamboats for the mills, and laid up against the
shore, waiting their turn to be sawed into lumber&mdash;and
slabs for Ned to pile! Sometimes their outer
edge extended clear to the channel, and to dive from
here into the swift, dusky current thirty feet in depth
was tremendously exhilarating. When you came to
the surface you were fifteen or twenty yards below
the point whence you had started.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the rafts was slack water,
where you could swim with no fear of being carried
away. An especially good feature about the rafts
lay in the fact that the logs were nice and clean, and
when you dressed you did not get sand in your
stockings.</p>

<p>Second, there was the large sand-bar opposite the
upper part of town. In low water this bar was
enormous, comprising several acres. Its foot shelved
rapidly, so that you could dive from the firm brink
into six feet of beautiful, still water. The bar reached
up-river, it seemed forever; and over the dry, fine
sand, or splattering madly, with the water only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
your ankles (keeping, of course, a sharp lookout for
step-offs) and your flat soles sending the sparkling
drops far and wide, you could run around until tired.
The sand-bar was the best resort of the three.</p>

<p>In very low water, it was possible to wade from it
to the mainland on the Beaufort side; and to swim
to the other mainland was no trick at all, if you knew
the shortest route.</p>

<p>Third, there was the sandy beach across the river.
This was the place most popular; for although the
water here was not so sweet and fresh as that of the
rafts and bar, the beach was convenient, safe, and
available throughout the season.</p>

<p>The rafts were not safe for the weak swimmer, because
of the current; at a normal stage of water the
bar was a mere uncertain patch; but the beach was
always good-natured and ready.</p>

<p>At present it was to the beach that Ned and his
chums went. Off the rafts the water was decidedly
frigid; the sand-bar was just beginning to show its
face, covered with a thin coating of mud left by the
receding freshet&mdash;and how cold this water in the
middle of the river was! The beach now held open
house for Beauforters, young and old.</p>

<p>The boys went over every afternoon in Ned and
Hal’s scull-boat and in skiffs. The entertainment
afforded by the beach was endless. A quarter of a
mile above, a point of land jutted out, thus throwing
the current from the shore. In some places the beach
sloped gently; in others it pitched abruptly into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
water. You could wade or you could dive, or you
could bravely launch yourself, paddle a short distance,
and if you had aimed exactly right you could then
let yourself down upon a shoal, with the water up to
your neck, and the undertow tugging at your feet.
Or you could swim straight out until into the current,
and turning upon your back could deliciously float
along as far as you deemed prudent, with the sky over
your face, and the shore passing in review in the
corner of an eye, and the saucy waves slapping at
your nose.</p>

<p>Between times, here was the soft, hot sand in which
to roll and bask.</p>

<p>Not to be omitted from the program were those
times when a rafter, or a stern-wheeler packet,
ploughed up stream (the up-boats raised the biggest
swells), spreading in-shore long rollers and breakers
whose oncoming was rapturously awaited by the
bevy of bathers.</p>

<p>The beach resort was so well rummaged and understood,
that rarely did a tragedy occur at it, and
had Ned and his crowd stayed strictly within bounds
they would not have met with this experience which
is about to be related.</p>

<p>On an afternoon toward the last of June they were
swimming at the beach; two boat-loads of them&mdash;Ned
and Hal and Bob, Frank Dalby, Sam Dalrymple,
Orrie Lukes, Tom Pearce, Phil Ruthers, Les Porter,
and others. They had been skylarking to their
hearts’ content; playing tag, leap-frogging into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
water, or diving slily and catching an unsuspecting
friend around the ankles. The scull-boat had been
capsized, and much sport was found in coming up
under it, where was air-space for breathing, and hooting
for the benefit of the outsiders. The packet <cite>Pittsburg</cite>,
which had the reputation of making the highest
waves of any of the steamers save the rafter <cite>Reindeer</cite>,
even had surged by, leaving behind her swells and
joy.</p>

<p>All was peace and good humor, when a skiff was
descried approaching.</p>

<p>The boys glanced only carelessly at it, until Ned
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Say! There comes the South Beaufort gang!”</p>

<p>His words put a damper upon the frolicking. All
gazed uneasily, and fidgeted. The rough boys forming
what was styled the “South Beaufort gang” were
their regular enemies.</p>

<p>“Well, who cares?” demanded Tom Pearce, defiantly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” chimed in Les Porter. “They
don’t own the beach.”</p>

<p>“No; but they’ll try to run us off,” asserted Hal.
“Those Sullivans are always spoiling for a fight, and
they don’t fight fair, either.”</p>

<p>“They chaw raw beef on you, and paste mud at
you,” complained Orrie Lukes, the smallest of the
party.</p>

<p>“Eight of them,” remarked Sam Dalrymple, who
had been counting. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>“The two Sullivans, and the
Conners, and Big Mike Farr, and I don’t know who
else.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, fellows,” suggested Ned; “we don’t
want any trouble&mdash;let’s go down to the breakwater
and fool.”</p>

<p>The plan met with some grumbling from Tom and
Les and other stubborn spirits; but it won, and
dumping their clothes into their skiff they made a
change of base, wading and swimming and towing
their boats, the scull-boat bottom up.</p>

<p>The South Beaufort gang did not follow them, but,
disembarking upon the beach, went in swimming.</p>

<p>The breakwater was a few rods down stream. It
was a long, stout parapet of heavy, square timbers
laid end to end, bolted and braced. It extended up
from the bridge, parallel with the shore, for two hundred
yards, and was designed to aid the rafters in
sliding their rafts through; it held the rafts off from
the shore.</p>

<p>Behind it was water more or less shallow, and lukewarm
from the sun. In front of it was deep water,
and considerable current.</p>

<p>At the risk of getting numerous splinters some of
the boys scaled the breakwater by running up the
braces planted against it in the rear, the others
amused themselves among the tiny bays and inlets
formed between it and the shore line. Bob, after
vainly trying to follow Ned to the top, decided that
he would take a turn through the near-by woods.</p>

<p>The breakwater was amply broad enough to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
secure footing. The boys lolled about upon it, the
sunshine soaking them through and through, and the
novelty of their high position adding to the fun.</p>

<p>“Come on; let’s dive, all together,” proposed Ned,
briskly rousing to action.</p>

<p>“That’s right&mdash;all together,” seconded Tom.</p>

<p>Nobody opposed, and the six of them stood in a
row.</p>

<p>“I’ll count, and at ‘three’ down we go,” said Ned.
“Make ready&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sam and I are going to jump; because when we
dive head-first we get water up our nose,” explained
Phil Ruthers.</p>

<p>“Aw, it’s only eight or ten feet!” protested Hal.</p>

<p>“Just the same, I’m not going to get water up <em>my</em>
nose,” declared Sam, irritated.</p>

<p>“Make ready,” warned Ned, again; and the boys
poised for the plunge.</p>

<p>“One&mdash;two&mdash;three!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>With six splashes, almost like one, they struck the
water and disappeared, the four divers entering in
regulation style, but Sam and Phil upright, each with
one hand closing tight his precious nose.</p>

<p>In a moment heads bobbed, one after another,
above the surface, their owners shaking them vigorously
and snorting and blowing, while lustily swimming,
hand over hand, for the breakwater.</p>

<p>This the boys climbed from in front by sticking
their toes into the wide cracks between the lines of
timbers, and by clinging to protruding bolts. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
more on the top, they were resting, and chaffing
when, in a startled tone, Hal exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;where’s Tom?”</p>

<p>Quite so; where was Tom? Six figures had left
the breakwater, but only five were upon it now!
The boys looked at each other inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s with the other crowd,” volunteered
Sam, and peering over he called down to ask. Tom
wasn’t there.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s hiding, to scare us,” guessed Frank
Dalby, weakly.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;Tom wouldn’t do that,” asserted Ned; and
the faces of the boys grew pale. “He must be down
there still!” leaning over and scanning the placid
current. “I bet he never came up! Where was he
standing?”</p>

<p>“He was right between Hal and me,” excitedly
said Phil. “Wasn’t he, Hal? And I stood here&mdash;just
exactly, because I remember it by the broken
nut on this bolt.”</p>

<p>“Tom! Oh, Tom!” shouted Frank, hopelessly.</p>

<p>No answer. The news had passed to the remainder
of the bathers, below, and a buzz of frightened
talk arose.</p>

<p>“I’m going after him,” hurriedly announced Ned.
“You fellows watch close. I reached bottom easy before.”</p>

<p>“So did I, so did I! Let <em>me</em> go! I’ll go!” came
an eager chorus.</p>

<p>“I’m first,” replied Ned, with dogged firmness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
“Get out of the way, Hal! If I find him you fellows
can come down and help.”</p>

<p>Placing himself a little above where Tom had
stood, he dived with all his might.</p>

<p>In a few kicks he brought up against the muddy
bottom. Groping around about him in the cold, rayless
regions, he suffered the current to bear him
slowly along, now and then paddling enough to keep
himself from rising.</p>

<p>He felt beneath him mud; nothing but mud;
slimy, oozy, freezing mud with clam-shells and sticks
and rocks embedded in it. Then, on a sudden, his
hands felt something else&mdash;a smooth, not unfamiliar
object&mdash;it was a leg&mdash;it was Tom! Yes, Tom!</p>

<p>Ned’s heart made a great leap of joy. With Tom
in his arms he shot upward&mdash;it seemed an endless
journey&mdash;and bursting, exhausted, but exulting,
reached the surface.</p>

<p>The instant that he came in sight the boys&mdash;by
this time the breakwater held them all&mdash;who had
been watching and waiting, saw at once his burden,
and swarmed to his rescue. They towed the unconscious
Tom through a gap in the timbers, and
stretched him in the sun upon the hot sand, and
rubbed him, and rolled him, and worked so fiercely
that in fifteen minutes he showed signs of life, again.</p>

<p>Another fifteen, and he moaned; at which Bob,
who was much moved by the proceedings, howled in
sympathy.</p>

<p>When he was able to sit up they bound his head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which was severely cut, dressed him, after a fashion,
and hurried him in the skiff to town, Ned, as was
fitting, happily nestling beside him, and the scull-boat
desperately following in their wake.</p>

<p>A doctor sewed up Tom’s scalp, and it is a question
who was the prouder&mdash;the boys of Ned, or Tom
of his ten stitches.</p>

<p>As for Ned, himself&mdash;he was not proud, precisely;
rather, he was thankful and satisfied.</p>

<p>The only thing that occurred to mar his pleasure
was the action of Zulette&mdash;called Zu-zu&mdash;Tom’s little
sister. She found him sitting by Tom’s chair, that
evening, on the Pearce front porch; and with an
“Oh, Ned! Aren’t you brave!” she ran up to him,
and left on his face two tears and a kiss. Then she
ran into the house, crying as hard as she could cry.</p>

<p>Ned wiped his cheek, and wished that she wouldn’t
behave so silly. To be kissed by a girl&mdash;that was
too much! And why was she crying, when Tom
was safe!</p>

<p>After the merits of the various theories had been
well argued, it was generally accepted that Tom had
received his cut by striking a sunken pile. However,
no one went down into the water to see. The accident
put an end to diving off the breakwater.</p>

<span class = "small">THE CAMP AT DEEP CREEK</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">When</span>, of the eleven loads of wood, about
three were still unpiled, Ned began to feel
need of a change of air. It seemed to
him that the climate of Deep Creek, sixteen miles
down the river, would be just the thing for him.</p>

<p>In short, he was stricken by his annual violent attack
of the camping-out-fever&mdash;a malady very popular
during the summer, in Beaufort.</p>

<p>Hal, too, was taken at the same time. The symptoms
were a burning desire to get away from town,
and into the woods; to lie around in old clothes, regardless
of time, and free from all fuss; to amuse
oneself as one pleased; to be lazy; to be uncivilized
and unwashed; to row a boat, which is fun, instead
of to pile wood, which is work.</p>

<p>The two boys compared notes, and agreed, Bob
voting “yea,” that the sooner they left, the better.
Deep Creek appealed to both as the proper locality;
and Bob, it goes without comment, stood ready to
follow them any place.</p>

<p>Hal, whose father was less strict as to chores than
was Ned’s, was used to dropping into the Miller back
yard, once in a while, mornings, and giving Ned the
comfort of company at the wood-pile. This lightened
Ned’s labors, but it did not hasten them, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
there were moments when the talk grew so interesting
that he forgot to keep the slabs moving.</p>

<p>The camping-out fever now interfered seriously
with the progress of the piling. To make matters
worse, these three remaining loads were the most
stubborn, closely packed loads conceivable. So
stubborn were they, that it was as if they grew each
night, and thus made up what they had lost during
the day!</p>

<p>Camping details all had been discussed and settled,
and finally Hal, who had been impatiently awaiting
the last hour of the heap, said boldly:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask your father to let you go
anyway, Ned, and tell him you’ll pile the rest when
you come home? It will have lots of time to dry
before winter!”</p>

<p>“He won’t, I know,” replied Ned, sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I bet he will,” insisted Hal. “He doesn’t
care when the wood’s piled, if it’s only dry in time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll ask him,” sighed Ned. “But he won’t,
I know.”</p>

<p>He mustered his courage, and at the table that
noon he hinted:</p>

<p>“Tom Pearce and Joe Cluny and a lot of other
fellows went camping this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” responded his father, politely.</p>

<p>“I wish Hal and I could go,” continued Ned.</p>

<p>“But I thought you were going,” remarked Mr.
Miller. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>“I thought you had arranged to go to Deep
Creek.”</p>

<p>“I mean, I wish we could go right away, when fishing’s
good,” explained Ned, squirming in his chair.</p>

<p>“What is hindering?” inquired his father, looking
wondrous ignorant.</p>

<p>“The wood,” faltered Ned. Then he blurted:
“Say&mdash;can’t I finish it when I come back? It’s just
a little bit.”</p>

<p>“Neddie!” reproved his mother. “The idea of
addressing your father with ‘say’!”</p>

<p>“Oh! The wood still hangs on, does it?” asked
his father, innocently. “Well, Ned, since it is ‘just
a little bit’ you can finish it up to-morrow, I should
think, and have it off your hands. Besides, don’t
you remember that I told you the wood must be
piled, first, and the camping could follow?”</p>

<p>“Y-y-yes,” admitted Ned.</p>

<p>“If Hal is in such a hurry,” added his mother,
“why don’t you suggest to him that he might help
you out by piling, instead of hindering you by
talking?”</p>

<p>Ned lapsed into silence. It was no use; the conversation
had ended as he had expected. He had
only proved that he knew his father much better than
Hal did.</p>

<p>Yet, although Hal had failed on one tack, it was
he who really brought the rescue, after all. When,
within an hour, Ned reported to him the failure of
plans for a truce, Hal thought an instant, and suddenly
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell you! I’ll come down early to-morrow
morning, and we’ll jump into that wood and not stop
’til it’s finished!”</p>

<p>And to their great relief and no doubt to the surprise
of the wood, the last slab had been laid in place
before noon of the next day!</p>

<p>They spent that afternoon collecting their camping
outfit.</p>

<p>This consisted of blankets and provisions, mainly,
although Mrs. Miller made Ned, to his disgust, take
a few extra articles of clothes. Mothers seem unable
to grasp how little a boy needs, in that line, when
camping in summer!</p>

<p>They gaily trundled a full wheelbarrow-load of
stuff down to the Diamond Jo warehouse; then
they returned up-town to buy a lot of canned goods,
and coffee and sugar, with which to eke out the
bread and potatoes and onions, etc., furnished by the
home larders.</p>

<p>These store things also having been wheeled to the
warehouse, nothing now was left to do but to wait
until morning.</p>

<p>“Why, Ned&mdash;aren’t you going to have a tent?”
exclaimed his mother, shocked.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” snorted Ned, in disdain.
“There’s a shed we can go under if it rains.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller, in dismay, broke the news to her husband,
but he merely laughed, and said, patting her
shoulder:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“It won’t hurt them any. When they get enough
they can come home.”</p>

<p>“It won’t hurt them any,” was a favorite remark
of Mr. Miller’s. He had great faith in the happy-go-lucky
ways of the average healthy boy, and his
theory rarely was at fault.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Miller, not yet at ease, continued to
hover around Ned, and ask him other anxious questions
which seemed to him very foolish, but which to
her seemed quite natural.</p>

<p>“Neddie, I really don’t believe you’re going to
have plenty to eat!” she asserted.</p>

<p>“With two trot-lines? My, yes!” assured Ned.
“Why, we can live on just fish!”</p>

<p>His words had such a ring of confidence that his
mother&mdash;although “trot-lines” was a complete mystery
to her&mdash;accepted them, and tried not to worry.</p>

<p>At half-past six the next morning Ned and Hal
and Bob were at the warehouse, waiting for the
steamer <cite>Harriett</cite>. The <cite>Harriett</cite> was a daily packet
between Beaufort and Rapids City, forty miles below,
and not only stopped at the towns between, but also
would take on and put off passengers at points,
wherever requested, along the shores.</p>

<p>At seven the <cite>Harriett</cite> came down from North
Beaufort, where she was tied up at night, and thrust
her nose upon the levee beside the warehouse. The
two boys and Bob gladly scampered aboard, over
the gangplank; the roustabouts carried on the two
boxes containing the camp stuff, and while its owners
nervously watched, hauled the scull-boat from the
water, and stowed it, too, below deck. All the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
freight having been cleaned up, the <cite>Harriett</cite> whistled
for the bridge to open, and at the same time backed
out.</p>

<p>At last the boys were off.</p>

<p>Commodore Jones had just settled himself on his
little platform, for a morning smoke, and running up
on the hurricane deck, they leaned out, toward him,
as they passed, and called:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mr. Jones. Want any fish?”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he shouted, waving his pipe. “Yes;
bring ’em&mdash;when you get ’em!”</p>

<p>Through the draw sped the <cite>Harriett</cite>, and on past
the Mosher Lumber Mill (disfigured but busy), past
Eagle Island (Bob not deigning a glance at his old
homeplace), and on, with a stop or so, until soon the
Deep Creek landing was right ahead.</p>

<p>This landing was at a government light upon a
small peninsular. A few rods above, the Monga, a
shallow but wide and swift stream, emptied into the
Mississippi, and to reach the Deep Creek grounds it
was necessary to cross. People who had no skiff
with them signaled to Joe and Sam, fishermen who
lived beside the creek, to come and ferry them over.
Ned and Hal and Bob, however, had the scull-boat;
and when they and their traps and their craft had
been dumped ashore, all at once, and the <cite>Harriett</cite>
was fussily hurrying away, they lost no time in loading
up and pushing off.</p>

<p>Now, Deep Creek was not truly a creek. It was a
narrow slough, extending parallel with the Mississippi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
between an island and the shore. It was a
popular resort for fishing parties, and a number of
Beaufort men had erected a little cabin beside it, for
use as a club-house.</p>

<p>Having passed the mouth of the Monga the boys
entered the slough. Sam and Joe, always upon the
outlook for a job when the <cite>Harriett</cite> was due, were
standing in front of their shanty, and opposite them
Hal and Ned rested on their oars, to ask:</p>

<p>“How’s fishing?”</p>

<p>“Good,” replied the brothers, together.</p>

<p>“Anybody else down here?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>Sam and Joe shook their heads, again together.
They had this peculiarity, possibly from being so
much in each other’s company, night and day. One
thought appeared to do for both, and when they
spoke, or laughed, or wagged their heads, they did
so as one man! Considering that they lived by
themselves, summer and winter, in their shanty on
the bank of the slough, the wonder is, not that they
grew to think alike, but that they did not grow to
<em>look</em> alike, as well!</p>

<p>Sam had red hair and red whiskers and a red,
freckled skin; Joe had iron-gray hair and whiskers,
and a skin tanned deep as mahogany. Sam was
quick-tempered; Joe was easy-going. Both were
reserved in manner and chary of words.</p>

<p>The boys proceeded up the slough a quarter of a
mile, and landed. Here they pitched their camp by
tucking their boxes under a wild-grape arbor at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
water’s edge, and sitting upon them. The sun was
high, and the thick shade of the arbor was an agreeable
relief from the hot row along the glassy bayou.</p>

<p>“This is better than any tent,” declared Ned.
“Isn’t it!”</p>

<p>“Lots!” responded Hal, with enthusiasm. “Now
let’s set our trot-lines.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>Bob took no part in this conversation. While yet
the scull-boat had been six feet from the bank he had
leaped over the bows, and half-swimming, half-wading,
had scrambled ashore, to disappear in the woods.
Probably his doggy mind was bent upon discovering
a nice camping spot, in advance of his chums. But
he must have missed the grape-arbor and his chance,
for here was the camp&mdash;and no Bob!</p>

<p>Fumbling in one of the boxes Ned pulled out the
trot-lines, rolled in two big balls, and the bunch of
hooks to be attached, and a large slab of liver for
bait. Then he and Hal started off again in the scull-boat.</p>

<p>“Trot-lines” are long lines to which fish-hooks are
hung, at near intervals, by pieces of cord. Some
trot-lines are strung with a hundred or two hundred
hooks. The boys’ lines were only three hundred
feet in length, and they counted on hanging fifty
hooks to each. The trot-lines were the size of window-cord,
or braided clothes-line, and had been
tarred so that they should not rot.</p>

<p>Ned and Hal slowly sculled up the slough, keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
their eyes open for good places at which to set out
their lines. Presently they came to an old raft&mdash;or,
rather, but a portion of a raft&mdash;lying along the island
side of the bayou. It must have been in Deep Creek
for years, because the logs were green with mossy
growth. It was a peaceful old raft, dozing here, forgotten,
with one edge high and dry among the island
brush, and the other edge well out into the slough.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;we can tie the lines to the raft!” proposed
Ned, struck with the idea.</p>

<p>“I should smile!” assented Hal, slangily.</p>

<p>“One above and one below,” continued Ned.
“Let’s fix the upper one first.”</p>

<p>As they skirted the outer logs, on ahead of them
turtles, sunning themselves, slid hastily into the water,
and the route of the boat was thus marked by a succession
of splashes.</p>

<p>The boys were nearing the head of the raft, when
Ned stopped sculling, and asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with this?”</p>

<p>“It’s about right, I guess,” replied Hal. “We
can tie to that pin.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ned, “I’ll hold the boat steady, and
you fix the line.”</p>

<p>He turned the boat in hard against a log from
which jutted a stout wooden pin almost touching the
water. Hal, reaching over the bow, securely tied
the end of his line. Then with a shove he sent the
boat away, toward the middle of the slough, and
Ned gently sculled until they had gone at right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
angles about twenty yards, with the line trailing between
the boat and the raft.</p>

<p>Now Hal deftly attached the first hook by its two
feet of cord, baited it with a bit of liver, and let it
slide overboard. Three feet farther along the line
he fastened another hook; and in this manner they
went edging across the slough, until the fifty hooks
had been tied on and baited.</p>

<p>The next step was to sink the line. Hal tied
upon the free end two heavy coupling links which
had been stored in under the bows. Ned sculled
ahead, slightly up stream, to make allowance for the
sluggish current, until the line, with its dangling
hooks and liver, was fairly taut.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” remarked Hal; with a clink
the coupling links disappeared beneath the surface,
and the line followed.</p>

<p>They were on their way to the foot of the raft, to
set out their second line, when a piercing howl from
the main shore startled them. It was Bob, lonesome,
disgusted and impatient, demanding that they
return to land and to him. Where he had been,
they did not know. But now he was sitting at the
water’s brink, directly opposite them, and accusing
them of deserting him.</p>

<p>“Bob, be quiet!” ordered Ned.</p>

<p>However, Bob, hearing the voice, and judging that
his howling was to be in vain, decided that since
they would not come to him he would go to them;
whereupon with a yelp of defiance he plunged into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the slough, and yapping at intervals laid a course for
the boat.</p>

<p>“Go back, Bob! Go back, sir!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Let him come, Ned,” pleaded Hal. “He won’t
do any harm.”</p>

<p>“He’ll only eat the liver, if he has half a chance,
and hang himself on a hook!” exclaimed Ned.
“Help me make him go back.”</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Hal, understanding the situation,
took sides with Ned against Bob, and the two
boys yelled commands, and splashed with the oars.</p>

<p>Bob, wavering in the face of such a hostile reception,
hesitated, swam in a circle, and finally
sought the shore again. Here he contented himself
with parading up and down, and venting his feelings
by short, indignant barks.</p>

<p>The second trot-line was put out, from a point
near the foot of the raft, by a method similar to that
already told. Slanting athwart the depths of the
slough the two lines now extended, ready for business.
Satisfied, and also very hungry, the boys made
for shore and the grape arbor, where they were
joyously welcomed by Bob.</p>

<p>According to the height of the sun, as well as to
their stomachs, it was ripe noon, and time for dinner.
By common consent, in their outings, Hal, who had
a knack in that direction, was the cook. It was
Ned’s duty to provide the wood, and to attend to
camp affairs generally outside of the meals.</p>

<p>Bob was watchman and sergeant-at-arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“What will we have?” inquired Hal.</p>

<p>“Oh, anything,” answered Ned; “just so we have
it quick!”</p>

<p>“Bacon and potatoes, fried together,” proffered
the cook.</p>

<p>And bacon and thin slices of potatoes, fried together
in a skillet over a brisk little fire of branches
and driftwood, it was!</p>

<p>“I tell you there’s nothing like bacon!” sighed
Ned, scraping his tin plate.</p>

<p>“And potatoes!” sighed Hal, also scraping. (Who
says that cooking spoils the appetite!)</p>

<p>Bob, having gobbled his share, was trying to lick
the hot skillet!</p>

<p>“Do you know what we forgot?” exclaimed Ned,
thunder-struck. “Coffee!”</p>

<p>“But if I’d had to make coffee you’d have had
to wait a lot longer for dinner. It takes an age
to boil water over a fire like that one,” explained
Hal.</p>

<p>“Well, bacon and potatoes and slough water are
good enough&mdash;in a hurry,” admitted Ned.</p>

<p>Bob cleaned the skillet and Ned the plates&mdash;the
grease yielding before a liberal rubbing with wet
mud&mdash;and Hal, digging a hole at the water’s edge,
buried the fruit-jar containing their supply of butter,
so that it should not melt too much.</p>

<p>This precaution having been taken, and the camp
tidied, Hal mused, looking up toward the raft:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ve caught any fish, yet.”</p>

<p>“It’s too soon to go and see,” replied Ned, wistfully.
“About four o’clock will be time enough to
try. Let’s visit Sam and Joe.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” agreed Hal.</p>

<p>They found the Morgan brothers at home, and apparently
glad to receive company. A large brindle
dog was much less hospitable, and during the boys’ stay
he and Bob kept up a constant exchange of sneers and
threats. In fact, a pitched battle was only narrowly
avoided&mdash;partly through the efforts of the Morgans,
and partly because Bob would not stir from between
Ned’s legs.</p>

<p>The atmosphere about the shanty was quite fishy,
and fish scales were scattered everywhere. There
also was another, much stronger odor, at which the
three newcomers wrinkled their noses in disgust.</p>

<p>Joe was occupying a bench, puffing at his pipe;
and sitting on a second bench, with a board across
his lap, Sam, likewise puffing, was cutting into
small square cakes what seemed to be a mass of
dough.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” said the boys&mdash;Ned holding Bob by
the collar.</p>

<p>The two men nodded gravely, and Joe, removing
his pipe to knock out the ashes, remarked:</p>

<p>“Got your lines set all right? See you fussin’
’long the logs a bit ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we thought we’d try a couple, just for fun,”
responded Ned. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>“Do you think the raft is a good
place?”</p>

<p>“W-w-well, I shouldn’t wonder but what it is, for
a short line,” said Joe, filling his pipe.</p>

<p>“Will we get any fish, Joe?” queried Hal.</p>

<p>“Mebbe,” said Joe. “A few cats, like as not.”</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;what’s Sam doing?” questioned Ned, sniffing
and frowning.</p>

<p>“He’s&mdash;makin’&mdash;dough&mdash;balls,” said Joe, between
puffs of his freshly lighted pipe.</p>

<p>“Dough-balls!” repeated Hal, quite in the dark.</p>

<p>“Yep,” said Joe. “We take a lot o’ cheese and
let it lay outdoors ’til it’s real old an’ then we mix it
with flour, into a paste, an’ when it’s good an’ stiff
we cut it into the right size for bait&mdash;like Sam’s
doin’ now. Them’s dough-balls. Smell ’em?”</p>

<p>“Smell ’em!” cried both boys together.</p>

<p>“Well, the fish smell ’em, too,” said Joe, tersely.</p>

<p>“What you boys usin’?” inquired Sam, speaking
for the first time since their appearance.</p>

<p>“Liver,” stated Hal.</p>

<p>“That’s better ’n dough-balls, I reckon,” grunted
Sam. “But if you had four or five hunderd hooks
to keep baited, you’d right soon run out o’ liver, I
bet.”</p>

<p>“You see, we’ve only fifty hooks on each line,” explained
Ned, modestly. “When we haven’t any
liver we’re going to use frogs, and crawfish and
things.”</p>

<p>“How often ought we to run the lines?” asked
Hal. “Every four or five hours?”</p>

<p>“If you’re a might to,” replied Joe. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>“O’ course,
we run ours only mornin’ an’ night, but it’s kinder
more of a job than <em>yours</em> be! If I was you I’d run
’em ’bout five o’clock, an’ then ’long ’bout ten, again,
to bait ’em for the night, an’ again arly in the
mornin’, an’ mebbe at noon.”</p>

<p>“That’ll keep ’em baited in good shape,” put in
Sam, “an’ you ought to get fish if there’s any
’round.”</p>

<p>“All right; much obliged,” responded the boys.</p>

<p>“In case you get more’n you can eat at one haul,”
offered Joe, kindly, “there’s a fish-box, down in
the water near that stake, that we ain’t using, and
you can have it so’s to keep ’em alive, if you
want to.”</p>

<p>“Sure; take it along,” urged Sam.</p>

<p>“I should say we <em>would</em> like it! It’s just the
thing!” exclaimed the boys, delighted. “Much
obliged.”</p>

<p>They hung around for a short time, and then,
haunted by that fish-box, hastened back to camp&mdash;Bob
growing braver and braver as they put distance
between them and the brindled dog&mdash;to bring down
their boat and get their prize.</p>

<p>Upon their return, with Joe’s help they loaded the
water-soaked box, dripping from every slat, into their
craft, and gleefully made off with it.</p>

<p>Soon they had it sunk and anchored in front of
their grape arbor.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it’s more than three, yet,” hinted
Hal, when, uncertain as to what to do next, to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
time fly, they paused and wiped their hands on their
trousers-legs.</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” agreed Ned, noting the height of
the sun. “But don’t let’s wait till five, this time,” he
proposed. “Let’s run the lines now, just for the fun
of it.”</p>

<p>Hal needed no persuasion. Leaving Bob to be
watchman over the camp, they pushed out again
from shore.</p>

<span class = "small">TURTLES, FISH, FROGS AND SNAKES</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Aiming</span> for the foot of the old raft, from
which the first of their two trot-lines had been
set out, Hal and Ned cut diagonally across
the bayou.</p>

<p>Not a waft of air riffled the water; the sun was reflected
from it as from a looking-glass, right into their
faces, and proceeded to turn their complexions redder
and redder. All around, the heads of curious turtles
dotted the surface, disappearing as the boat drew
near, and popping out again when it had passed.
Here and there a hungry gar or dog-fish leaped into
sight for an instant, while numerous king-fishers,
brave in their blue and white, plumped down, with
mighty splashes, for minnows.</p>

<p>The perspiration rolled from the face of Hal, who
was at the sculling-oar; dripped into his eyes, and
dropped off the end of his crimsoning nose. Yet
doubtless he felt cooler than did Ned, who, idle
in the bows, simply was baking instead of boiling.</p>

<p>However, neither cared. The weather figured little,
and they were more concerned over the immediate
future than over the present.</p>

<p>“I bet you we don’t get a thing except dog-fish!”
commented Hal, discouragingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we will,” returned Ned, with more hope.
“That is,” he added, “unless the turtles and gars rob
the hooks as fast as we bait up.”</p>

<p>“Well, may be; Sam and Joe seemed to think we
would, anyway,” admitted Hal, blowing the beads
from the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>They glided in against the raft, and Ned, reaching
over, grasped the line.</p>

<p>“Feel anything?” queried Hal, eagerly, as Ned
paused a moment.</p>

<p>“Seems kind of like it,” said Ned, fingering the
line. “But perhaps it’s only the current jerking.”</p>

<p>He lifted the line and laid it across the bows; and
squatting on the combing, beside it, gently pulled the
boat, hand over hand, toward the first hook.</p>

<p>“Nothing on that hook,” remarked Hal, as presently
the bit of cord by which it was suspended rose,
slack and lifeless, out from the water. Then the
hook itself dangled into view. No, it had nothing on
it&mdash;not even bait.</p>

<p>As it came in-board Ned stuck a piece of liver on
it and let it slide out again.</p>

<p>“Something’s coming!” he cried, jubilantly, his
hands pausing upon the line. “I can feel it now,
easy! See him jerk?”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Hal, excitedly, edging forward,
to be ready to help.</p>

<p>Hook two also was quite empty.</p>

<p>“Looks as though the slough’s having a good big
feast of liver, anyway!” commented Ned, baiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurry,” urged Hal; for now the line just beyond
was dipping and surging, under the struggles of something
on hook three.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;it’s a turtle! A big soft-shell&mdash;I saw him!”
exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!” responded Hal, disgusted. “Yes,
there he is!” as a stout flapper darted up into sight
and vanished again with a swirl.</p>

<p>Soon the line bent sharply over the side of
the boat, and in the water under their eyes the
boys could descry the sprawling disk of Mr.
Turtle.</p>

<p>“How will I get him <em>in?</em>” asked Ned, perplexed.</p>

<p>“Why, lift him right out,” answered Hal.</p>

<p>Ned gingerly drew the prisoner to the surface, and
then cried:</p>

<p>“The hook’s in his flapper! How do you suppose
he ever got caught that way?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Hal. “I guess he started
to eat with his fingers.”</p>

<p>“Or else he put his foot in his mouth, and got
hooked that way,” added Ned. “Did you say to lift
him right out?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“Supposing you do it,” suggested Ned, eyeing the
turtle, whose flappers, armed with long claws, were
striking in all directions as their owner strove to get
away.</p>

<p>Hal thoughtfully surveyed the situation.</p>

<p>“We ought to have a landing-net,” he declared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“But put your hands under the edge of his shell, and
throw him in. He won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of his biting me, but he scratches
like fury. His claws are about a mile long!” observed
Ned, dubiously preparing to follow Hal’s advice.</p>

<p>The turtle, for the moment, was quiet, possibly
waiting for his embarrassed captors to do something.
Ned suddenly grabbed him by the shell, and before
he realized what was taking place had heaved him
over the gunwale, into the boat.</p>

<p>The shock released the hook, which fell from the
flapper, and now a very angry turtle was at large in
quarters altogether too restricted to suit himself and
two bare-legged youths.</p>

<p>The turtle was about the size of a wash pan. He
was of the common sharp-nose, fresh-water variety,
of a drabbish-gray, with a smooth shell flexible like
cartilage. His legs were tremendously powerful, and
with his long, snaky neck far extended, his eyes
sparkling, and his mouth wide open, hissing with all
his might he made straight toward the stern and at
Hal.</p>

<p>“Look out!” warned Ned.</p>

<p>Narrowly escaping going overboard, Hal scrambled
upon the combing, and ran along it until he had
joined the laughing Ned, in the bows. Here, perched
upon the decking which extended over this portion
of the craft, they were out of harm’s way&mdash;that is,
the turtle’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>This individual, balked of a bite out of one of Hal’s
browned legs, endeavored to climb up the side of the
boat, but tumbled back time and again.</p>

<p>“I wish he’d go,” complained Ned. “We aren’t
after turtles, to-day.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Hal, ruefully wiggling a big toe,
which he had stubbed in his rapid flight. “We don’t
need him.”</p>

<p>“I got him in&mdash;you get him out,” proposed Ned,
shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Well, either he gets out, or we do,” declared Hal.
And he tried to assist the unwelcome captive by putting
an oar-blade under him. Every time, however,
the turtle slid off, and meanwhile grew madder and
madder&mdash;if such a condition were possible.</p>

<p>Hissing and clawing, he scurried over the bottom
of the boat.</p>

<p>Finally his turtle cunning led him to settle upon
the stern as the easiest point for escape; and never
giving up he attacked the sloping board again and
again, only to fall back. Each time that the boys
would have boosted him with an oar-blade he
turned and snapped, and appeared so ungrateful
that they were fain to leave him to his own
efforts.</p>

<p>At last he managed to insert the claws of a
hind flapper into the little space left by the oar
in the sculling-hole, and then was enabled to thrust
one of his fore flappers over the edge of the
stern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Up he went. For an instant he balanced on the
stern, his four legs and his stiff little tail, and his waving
head all outstretched in air.</p>

<p>“Scat!” called Ned.</p>

<p>At the word Mr. Turtle disappeared with a fine
splash.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Hal, much relieved.</p>

<p>“No more turtles come in <em>this</em> boat, do they,
Hal!” vowed Ned. “Better to cut the line, and be
rid of them.”</p>

<p>The boys now proceeded with their business&mdash;that
of finding out what else their hooks had in store for
them. Although the turtle was off, still the line
swayed and sagged, denoting another catch a short
distance ahead.</p>

<p>This proved to be on hook six.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing but a gar!” announced Ned, peering
down as he neared the spot.</p>

<p>“Big one?” queried Hal, anxious for at least some
consolation.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;just ordinary size,” said Ned, disdainfully.
“What will we do with him?”</p>

<p>The gar was now lying on the surface of the water,
beside the bows, only occasionally giving a slight
squirm. Maybe he was tired; or maybe, as in the
case of the turtle, he was waiting for an opportunity
to do a little damage. He was about three feet long,
and with his slim, round body, his wicked eyes,
and his bill-like mouth armed with sharp teeth, he
looked fully capable of taking care of himself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
hook was firmly embedded in the lower half of his
long, bony snout.</p>

<p>Ned cautiously extended his hand, to try to release
the barb&mdash;and the gar snapped viciously.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we can get the hook out unless we
kill him, and there’s no use doing that,” asserted Ned.
“He’s too coarse to eat.”</p>

<p>“Fishermen break their bills, and throw them back
again,” informed Hal.</p>

<p>“But that’s torture; it makes them starve to
death,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Can’t you jerk out the hook?” asked Hal.</p>

<p>Ned attempted this, by towing the gar back and
forth, and pulling on the hook at all angles. The
fish submitted passively, and suddenly appealed to
Ned as so helpless and so unhappy that with a quick
impulse he severed the cord. With a flop of his tail
the gar darted from sight.</p>

<p>“Get!” advised Ned.</p>

<p>He substituted another cord and hook, and both he
and Hal felt relieved.</p>

<p>Their mercy was rewarded, for when they had run
the line a few yards farther, they met with opposition
in the shape of a dead weight which caused Ned to
exert considerable strength to lift.</p>

<p>“Snag?” inquired Hal, anxiously, watching Ned
raising the line inch by inch.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” grunted Ned.</p>

<p>“Just our luck!” groaned Hal.</p>

<p>However, Hal was to be agreeably disappointed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
The knot fastening the cord to which was suspended
the hook came into view&mdash;and on the instant the
water underneath it swirled violently.</p>

<p>“It’s a big cat! Come on, Hal, and grab him, or
he’ll tear out the hook!” shouted Ned, wildly excited.</p>

<p>Carefully he seized the cord, and gently, so as not
to frighten the fish, drew him alongside.</p>

<p>“He’s caught just through the edge of his lip!
Watch out!” warned Ned.</p>

<p>Hal, regardless of any peril to himself, leaned far
over. The victim, sluggish but far from sleepy,
looked like a young whale. Hal boldly thrust his
fingers in behind the cat’s gills, to haul him bodily
over the gunwale; there was a sudden gigantic
flurry, a splash, and presto, change! Instead of it
being the cat in the boat, it was Hal in the slough!</p>

<p>Ned gazed in alarm; but before he could move to
the rescue Hal’s head broke the surface a few yards
off.</p>

<p>“Here’s an oar, Hal!” called Ned.</p>

<p>“Uh-uh!” protested Hal, shaking his head while
he blew the water from his nostrils. “I’m all right.
Did the fish get away?”</p>

<p>“I guess so&mdash;no, he didn’t, either!” announced
Ned gladly.</p>

<p>“I’ll swim around to the other side of the boat, and
you can be seeing if you can’t lift him in,” declared
Hal. “Don’t <em>you</em> tumble over, too,” he added, as a
caution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The catfish seemed to be satisfied with what he
had accomplished; and still about in the same spot,
made no sign of farther trickiness.</p>

<p>However, Ned was very careful in approaching
him. A moment, and the cat came over the one
gunwale as Hal came over the other.</p>

<p>The hook, which had caught merely in one of the
lips, where it had worn quite a hole, dropped while
Ned was lifting, and there lay the victim in the bottom
of the boat, free too late.</p>

<p>“A regular ‘yaller’ mud-cat,” laughed Ned.
“Say&mdash;but we were lucky not to lose him. If he’d
only had sense enough he might have got loose long
ago.”</p>

<p>“I bet he weighs twenty pounds,” declared the
dripping Hal.</p>

<p>“He’s all mouth!” returned Ned.</p>

<p>The boys gazed and gloated. The catfish, gasping
in the sudden change from water to air, lay, after
the fashion of his kind, inert and emotionless.</p>

<p>He was a very ugly animal, of a dirty yellow, and
while he was not large for his species, he was the
largest that the boys had ever caught. Indeed, he
was quite a chunk of a fish. He was shaped somewhat
like a flatiron; and, as Ned had remarked, he
was about all mouth.</p>

<p>This mouth, which in appearance was a split severing
his enormous head from side to side, was
fringed with long feelers. His eyes, almost white,
were small and piggish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cut off his head, and there’s nothing left but his
tail,” commented Ned, ruefully awakening to the fact
that perhaps they had not made much of a catch,
after all.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s better than turtles and gars,” replied
Hal.</p>

<p>For the time being the capture of the prize had
quite overshadowed Hal’s mishap; but now Ned
eyed him, and snickered.</p>

<p>“Did you touch bottom?” he queried.</p>

<p>“No, sir-ee; I came up as quick as I could,”
avowed Hal. “Do I look wet?” and he slapped his
oozing thighs.</p>

<p>“Sort of,” admitted Ned. “Where’s your hat?”</p>

<p>“It must have kept on going down,” answered
Hal. “But I don’t care. No&mdash;there it is. I feel
fine,” he added, having rescued his hat with an oar.
“You ought to go in&mdash;it’s great.”</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll wait a while,” smiled Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, in half an hour I’ll be as dry as you,” asserted
Hal.</p>

<p>And he was.</p>

<p>The catfish was too unwieldy to be put in the
soap-box seat (which they had upturned on bottom
for a temporary hold-all), and stowing him under the
decking of the bows, out of the sun, they investigated
the remaining hooks upon the line. A large
majority were stripped and empty, but two channel-cat
and one blue-cat were taken. None of these
weighed over six pounds; still, they were not seven-ninths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
head! No more turtles or gars were encountered.</p>

<p>The upper line yielded five catfish; another soft-shell
turtle, caught, as had been his partner in distress,
by the flapper; and a dogfish. The turtle
released himself, much to the boys’ pleasure; but the
dogfish did not. He had swallowed the hook, so
that the cord passed through his cruel jaws, armed
with their wicked teeth, into his stomach.</p>

<p>Unwilling to lose another hook, Ned solved the
difficulty by quickly dispatching Mr. Dogfish by a
smart blow over the spinal cord at the juncture of
head and body, and made use of the otherwise worthless
fellow by baiting hooks with his flesh.</p>

<p>Running the two lines had occupied at least two
hours. As they turned campward Hal and Ned were
conscious that nature’s dinner bell was sounding in
their interiors.</p>

<p>Bob saw them coming. At first he was undecided
whether to regard them as friends, or enemies.
When Ned shouted to him, however, his canine
sense told him that this was indeed the scull-boat,
bearing his master; and breaking from his puzzled
stare into a volley of whines and barks, he shortened
the distance by venturing up to his back out into the
water.</p>

<p>Then, when the boys sprang to land, he spattered
them well for not having invited him. But who
cared? They were about as wet and dirty as they
could be, anyway!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>As they disembarked, Sam and Joe pulled out,
below, with their short, choppy fisherman strokes,
bound for their own lines, which were not set in the
bayou, but in the deep water, toward the main
channel.</p>

<p>The boys waved at the pair, and Joe languidly
waved back.</p>

<p>Now it remained to place in the fish-box the
haul from the trot-lines, and to get supper. Hal
volunteered to cook a fish if Ned would clean one,
but Ned decided that this would make a painful
delay.</p>

<p>He hastily started a fire of driftwood and branches,
and until there should be coals upon which to put the
frying-pan, he strolled with Bob back into the timber
to look for more fuel.</p>

<p>Presently, unable to stay long away from the base
of supplies, he returned to the camp. He had some
news.</p>

<p>“You just ought to see!” he reported to Hal, who
was squatting before the fire, frying potatoes and
bacon together. “There’s a sort of dried swamp a
little ways back in the woods, and it’s simply alive
with young frogs. They’ll make splendid bait.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and get a lot, after supper,” said Hal.
“I don’t suppose the liver will be any good by morning.
And, besides, it’s about all gone.”</p>

<p>Ned seated himself on the ground, and sniffed the
air. Bob did the same.</p>

<p>“Nearly ready?” they asked&mdash;the one with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
voice, the other with his dripping tongue, and glistening
eyes, and nervous tail.</p>

<p>“Hold your plate,” commanded Hal. Ned eagerly
obeyed; Bob, having no plate, gazed covetously.
Hal shoveled out a generous portion from the hissing
frying-pan, and saying: “Here, Bob,” laid another
portion upon a slab of bark. The rest he kept.</p>

<p>Each boy poured for himself, from the tin pail, a
pint cup of coffee, and all fell to. Bob went coffee-less&mdash;which
no doubt was just as well, considering
that at home neither he nor his master drank any
coffee, let alone a pint cup full!</p>

<p>Still, out camping one does many things which
would not agree with one at home.</p>

<p>The coffee was very hot. The bacon and potatoes
were very hot. Bob circled his bark plate, with
mingled anticipation and disgust; hunger urged him
on, while the memory of a certain burning mouthful
held him back. He suspected a trick.</p>

<p>At last, valor overcoming discretion, he plunged
ahead, and gobbled as fast as he could, while his
companions jeered.</p>

<p>The supper having been cleared away&mdash;and save
rinsing the utensils there was no “clearing” to be
done, after two hungry boys and a dog had scraped
and licked&mdash;a frog hunt was inaugurated. Protected
now by shoes and stockings, the boys, taking the
willing Bob, proceeded to Ned’s swamp.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, a ball of dull red in the
golden west, and as the three chums traversed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
short patch lying between the dried marsh and their
arbor upon the bank of the slough, already the
wild-wood was growing dusky and subdued. Birds
were darting to their homes, and were twittering
their good-nights. A whippoorwill began to pipe
in the island across the bayou. Mosquitoes rose
from the under side of leaves, and here and there
moths flitted aimlessly. The mooing of cows, as
they were driven to the milking-place, floated in
from distant pastures.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” announced Ned, pausing on the
edge of a narrow open strip.</p>

<p>“Listen! What’s that funny noise?” exclaimed
Hal, stopping stock still. Bob who had been
soberly following at the boys’ heels, also stopped.</p>

<p>On the quiet atmosphere, almost from beneath
their feet, rose a series of shrill little squeaks&mdash;somehow
the oddest sounds that the trio ever had heard.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that funny!” whispered Ned. “What is it,
do you think?”</p>

<p>Hal didn’t know. Bob didn’t know.</p>

<p>Carefully they peered about, through the vicinity,
and found out.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned&mdash;it’s a frog!” on a sudden called Hal.
“Come quick, and see! Two garter snakes have
got hold of him!”</p>

<p>Ned hastened over, and sure enough, there was a
small frog in as tight a fix as ever a small frog could
be! Each hind leg was deep in the maw of a garter
snake; and now the two snakes, forced to suspend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
their swallowing operations, were lustily pulling in
opposite directions, while his frogship, stretched between
them, was shrieking for help.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! Let’s rescue the poor thing,” cried
Ned; and suiting his action to his word he struck
one of the snakes a blow with a switch that he had
in his hand. Startled, the snake dropped the frog&mdash;whereupon
the other would have fled with the booty,
had not Hal halted him and made him disgorge.</p>

<p>The frog, nothing daunted, hopped away. Bob
turned himself his avenger. Wrinkling back his
lips, with utmost disgust he seized the first snake, in
its retreat, and gingerly clutching it between his
teeth, while the saliva dripped from his unwilling
jaws, shook it frantically until it fairly flew to pieces.
The other snake, having for a moment bravely faced
Hal and menaced him with its tongue, disappeared.</p>

<p>“Snakes?” spoke Ned, pointing. “Why, just
look at them, will you!”</p>

<p>That swamp was fairly swarming with them, all,
like the boys, out after frogs. A garter snake considers
a young frog a dainty morsel, and some of the
snakes were quite lumpy, from the unlucky victims
that they had engulfed.</p>

<p>“Well, if this doesn’t beat the dickens!” declared
Hal.</p>

<p>Bob could not bring himself to mouthing another
of the snakes. He would pretend to pounce upon
one, and would quickly spring away, his curling lips
indicating his disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Undaunted by the competition, the boys, urged on
by the gathering darkness, hastened to collect their
frogs and put them in the coffee pail! Bob was of
not the slightest assistance. He loathed frogs as
much as he did snakes, and actually frothed at them,
so intense were his feelings.</p>

<p>“What do you think!” exclaimed Hal, presently.
“Here’s a snake that had swallowed a frog, and
when I came up he was so scared that he opened his
mouth, and the frog scooted out again!”</p>

<p>“Don’t catch him,” cried Ned, referring to the
frog. “He’s been dead once, and now he’s earned
his life.”</p>

<p>So Hal allowed the resurrected frog to go his way,
and it is to be hoped that the garter snakes were as
obliging.</p>

<p>By the time the boys had secured some twenty-five
or thirty of the tiny green frogs, each about
half an inch in length, twilight had deepened into
dusk, and trees and bushes were merged in shadows.</p>

<p>With a few stumbles over vines and roots they retraced
their steps to the arbor. Then arose the
question, where to keep the frogs, considering that
the pail would be needed for the breakfast coffee!</p>

<p>The voices of men talking, and the snappy sound
of oars shifting between thole pins drifted from the
mouth of the bayou.</p>

<p>“Sam and Joe are just coming back. Let’s go
down and report, and see if they haven’t something
we can borrow, to put the frogs in,” proposed Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>So the three of them trudged along the bank,
where a faint path had been worn. It was presumed
that Bob, of course, knew what was up. But after
they had gone far enough to indicate their goal, he
suddenly awakened to the fact that the route was
leading to the brindled dog, and refused to proceed
farther. He sat on his tail, and pleaded with his
two comrades not to expose themselves to insults
from that vulgar fellow. As they refused to yield to
him, he watched them until they were out of sight,
and followed them with his mournful howls. Then,
having done his duty, he returned to the grape arbor
camp, and curled to sleep on Ned’s coat.</p>

<p>Soon, even had they been blind to the flickering
light, and deaf to the muffled voices, by their noses
alone the boys would have known that they were
near the fishermen’s cabin. Sam and Joe were busy,
with aid of a lantern, at their landing. Evidently
they had just disembarked.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there!” hailed the boys.</p>

<p>“Hey!” cheerily answered Joe.</p>

<p>“Bow wow wow wow!” challenged the brindled
dog&mdash;exactly as Bob had predicted!</p>

<p>Sam said nothing. Sam was not much of a
talker.</p>

<p>The boys scrambled down to the landing. Joe
was in the stern of the boat, handing out things to
Sam, who was in the water beside it. Both men
had on their hip rubber boots.</p>

<p>“What luck?” asked Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not much,” replied Joe, without pausing in his
operations. “What did you boys get?”</p>

<p>“Seven catfish,” informed Ned, trying to make
his tone matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>“And two turtles and a gar and a dogfish,” added
Hal.</p>

<p>“And two turtles, and a gar, and a dogfish, eh?”
laughed Joe. “Well, I reckon that without ’em you
beat us. Fish out where we be are gettin’ ’bout
tired o’ dough-balls; ain’t that so, Sam?”</p>

<p>Sam grunted; giving the fish-box in front of him
a kick into deeper water, he plashed to shore, and
stumped up the slope to the cabin. Joe followed.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he invited, over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The boys entered. Sam was lighting a lamp in a
bracket against the wall. The cabin was small and
close, with its two bunks, its stove for cooking, and
its walls hung with clothing and cooking and fishing
utensils and decorated with prints. The room
was bedchamber, kitchen and parlor, in one.</p>

<p>“We can’t stay, thank you,” spoke Ned, fancying
that the two fishermen would want to attend to their
own affairs. “Only, we caught a lot of frogs for
bait, and haven’t anything to keep them in. Have
you got an old bucket, or some tin cans, we can
have?”</p>

<p>“Lot’s of ’em,” responded Joe. “Paw over that
heap back of the shanty, and take what you want.”</p>

<p>“Better have the lantern,” advised Sam&mdash;speaking
for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>With the brindled dog continuing to eye them as
if suspecting that they were stealing, Hal and Ned
looked over the pile of refuse, and came upon an old
tin pail which suited their purpose.</p>

<p>Having achieved this, and said good-night, they
went back to camp, through the darkness; and they
tripped so often, and stepped on so many rolling
sticks, and stones, that they wished they had their
own lantern along.</p>

<p>Upon hearing them approaching, the faithful Bob
was in arms at once, resolved to save the camp, or
die; but upon being reassured by Ned’s whistle and
call, he advanced and greeted them with his usual
wordiness, while he sniffed for traces of his down creek
enemy.</p>

<p>With nothing especial to do, immediately, the
boys sat on the bank, to wait. Now the woods behind
and the water in front were black, and the trees
across on the other side were but a vague mass. A
whole colony of whippoorwills whistled from point
to point incessantly, and two owls, one distant, one
quite near, hooted a responsive duet. Bob whined
and shivered, for the air was damp with the falling
dew and the mist rising from the water. Beyond, in
the channel of the river, sounded the soft exhaust of
an ascending rafter.</p>

<p>Despite the attentions of numerous mosquitoes,
Ned felt himself growing sleepy.</p>

<p>“Wonder what time it is,” he hazarded.</p>

<p>“Must be nearly nine,” said Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sam said to run the lines again about ten, didn’t
he?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, about ten, and early in the morning,” responded
Hal, drowsily.</p>

<p>Conversation languished; and after an interval of
silence, punctuated only by the spasmodic complaints
of Bob, who was acting very babyish, Ned
spoke up:</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;what’s the matter with running the lines
now, and not waiting till ten. I’m pretty near
asleep.”</p>

<p>“Let’s. So am I,” agreed Hal.</p>

<p>They lighted their lantern, and taking the liver,
the frogs and the remains of the dogfish, tumbled
into the scull-boat and pushed out. Behind them,
upon shore, stayed Bob, the disconsolate, who was
growing tired of always being “left.” He was positive
that he was missing much fun.</p>

<p>The Deep Creek of night was decidedly different
from the Deep Creek of day, just as the most open
woods, in the light, are transformed into regular
labyrinths, in the dark.</p>

<p>It was Ned’s turn to scull. It seemed to both
boys that they never would reach the raft, so fast
they appeared to glide, and yet so slow they were in
arriving. And all was so eerie&mdash;black slough, black
woods, black sky, and queer noises.</p>

<p>“There’s the raft, right ahead!” exclaimed Hal.</p>

<p>Whereupon they bumped into it.</p>

<p>The water, which was so playful as under the rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the sun it lapped the mossy old logs, now was
sullen and chill. Hal swung the lantern over, and
speedily found the end of the trot-line.</p>

<p>They were forced to run the lines by feeling rather
than by sight, for at best the beams of the lantern
were shifty and uncertain. Either they had come
again too soon, or the fish had gone to sleep, or
were gorged with liver, for two medium-size catfish,
one from each line, was the total yield.</p>

<p>The boys were a little disappointed. Out of the
assortment of dainties at hand having baited afresh
the empty hooks, they sculled back to camp, and
Bob.</p>

<p>With most of their clothing on, and their coats for
pillows, they rolled in their blankets, in the arbor,
(Bob contentedly between them), and not even the
over-sociable mosquitoes could hold them awake for
more than five minutes and a quarter.</p>

<span class = "small">THE GHOST OF THE INDIAN MOUNDS</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">The</span> sun, from his station a little north of
east, stared full into the grape arbor sleeping
room, and shone on Hal’s still face. A
fly hustled in, and buzzed about Hal’s nose. Hal
frowned, and impatiently shook his head; but unable
to rid himself of sun or fly, opened his eyes.
At the same instant Ned, beside him, stirred and
turned over, disturbing Bob, who had been very
comfortable.</p>

<p>Both boys sat up and blinked. Bob stretched,
shook himself, and strolled out.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;we’d better get out and run those trot-lines!”
yawned Ned. “We’ve overslept.”</p>

<p>“I should think so!” yawned back Hal.</p>

<p>“Do you know, when I woke, Bob was on my
stomach. He must have been there all night!”
announced Ned.</p>

<p>“He was keeping warm,” explained Hal.</p>

<p>“Well, he weighed about a ton,” responded Ned,
unwilling to make light of it. “But then,” he added,
“he kept me warm, too.”</p>

<p>The boys yawningly staggered to the water’s edge
and made their toilet in a tin basin, with the scull-boat
for a wash-stand. Already the sun was climbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
high, and the gnats and flies and all the world of
insect and bird were awake. Sam and Joe could be
descried at work on their lines, far outside the mouth
of the bayou.</p>

<p>Only the three tenants of Camp Grape Arbor were
sluggards!</p>

<p>Of these Bob was the friskiest. Ned and Hal,
while trying to be good natured, still were very irritable.
They were stiff and lame, and spotted with
mosquito bites. Their hands were painfully cracked
from water and dirt and the oar, and their faces,
burned by the sun, felt strangely leathery. Hal’s
nose was peeling, and Ned, who foolishly had rolled
up his sleeves, was the owner of a huge water blister
half way between left wrist and elbow.</p>

<p>However, when they once more were in the boat,
and had started for the lines&mdash;Bob again remaining
alone in camp, a state at which he never failed to
protest strongly&mdash;their spirits really rose, and they
were happy.</p>

<p>“There’s the <em>Harriett!</em>” said Ned, as the mellow
whistle of a steamboat signaling for a landing chimed
in the distance, over the water.</p>

<p>“Then it must be about eight o’clock!” cried Hal,
scandalized. “My! but we’re lazy!”</p>

<p>And to atone for their late rising he dug valiantly
with the sculling oar.</p>

<p>Their morning’s haul consisted of five catfish, and,
amid great rejoicing, a fine pickerel, for their fish-box;
a soft shell turtle, who so easily released his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
flapper, and swam off, that Ned declared he was one
of the two they had caught yesterday, and was
simply making his regular rounds; and a black bass,
a mere minnow, whose greediness had led him to
take into his mouth more than he could swallow.
Him the boys let go, to grow.</p>

<p>As on previous occasions, all the other hooks were
as bare of bait as of anything else, and Ned had to
scrape together every scrap at hand to rebait them.</p>

<p>Upon their return to camp the hungry boys, with
the ever-hungry Bob as assistant, had breakfast.
Breakfast consisted of&mdash;bacon and potatoes and coffee.
The critical Hal insisted that the coffee tasted
“froggy”; just the same, he drank it!</p>

<p>For dinner they planned a much grander menu.
But for the present, bacon and potatoes filled a crying
need.</p>

<p>It was necessary to get more bait; and refreshed
by their breakfast, the boys, having tidied camp to
the extent of hanging their blankets upon some
bushes in the sun to dry, went with Bob on another
frog hunt. They found frogs, but no snakes; evidently
the evening was the snakes’ special hour for
foraging.</p>

<p>In their search they followed adown the little
swamp which slanted in toward the river. It grew
wetter as they proceeded, and they were about to
leave it, when they heard a tremendous outburst of
barks and growls from Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, Bob! We’re coming, Bob, old fellow!”
they called, running helter-skelter to back him up, or
scold him, whichever was proper.</p>

<p>Bob was in a great dilemma. He had run across
an immense snapping-turtle, and did not know what
to do with it. He was afraid to close with it, and
yet he was unwilling to flee from it, therefore he had
adopted the middle course of circling it at a respectful
distance, and abusing it in dog language.</p>

<p>The turtle was a patriarch. His shell was thick
and black and knobby, and the skin of his neck and
legs was thick and black and warty. His claws were
long and curving, and as with his head he slowly followed
Bob’s antics, his deep-set eyes fairly flashed
sparks, while he held his formidable mouth half open,
as if hankering for a bite out of one of Bob’s
legs. How he hissed, with a hoarse, gaspy hiss! He
was so enraged that he filled the air with a musky
odor.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a whopper, though!” exclaimed Ned,
grasping Bob, who, at the arrival of reinforcements,
had waxed altogether too fierce for safety.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to have him get hold of <em>me!</em>” asserted
Hal, poking at the monster with a stick. The turtle
seized the stick with such a grip that he jerked it out
of Hal’s hands, and Mr. Hal involuntarily jumped back
a pace.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we aren’t wanted here,” remarked
Ned, laughing. “Come on, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Keep the stick,” called back Hal, as, dragging
the reluctant Bob, they moved off, leaving the turtle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his jaws firmly clamped upon the piece of wood, in
possession of the field of battle.</p>

<p>Having secured a supply of the hapless frogs, the
boys took a short cut to pay their respects to Sam
and Joe. Bob, after pretending that he was going
back to have it out with the turtle, finally cooled
down and trotted along with them. But he could
not be induced to approach the shanty, and with an
eye out for the brindled dog sat at a distance and
sorrowfully waited.</p>

<p>Sam was on the muddy beach, mending the seine;
Joe was moulding dough-balls, on the bench in front
of the cabin.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said the boys.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” replied Joe.</p>

<p>From the shady side of the shanty the brindled
dog growled; from the beach Sam nodded.</p>

<p>“How’s fishin’?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Pretty good,” answered Ned. “Only, we overslept.”</p>

<p>“Thought you did. Seen you weren’t up when
we went out, ’bout five o’clock,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Going to try the net?” inquired Hal, looking at
Sam and his task.</p>

<p>“Yes, thought we’d make a haul or two ‘crost the
river this afternoon,” informed Joe. “Ever see a big
seine laid?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“Better come along, then,” invited Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right&mdash;much obliged,” responded Ned and
Hal. “What time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some’ers after dinner toward the shank o’ the
afternoon,” replied Joe. “You watch, an’ when you
see us gettin’ ready, you come down.”</p>

<p>With this in prospect the boys gleefully returned
to camp, to run their trot-lines and to have an early
dinner. The running of the lines was not especially
a success, the haul being only two catfish; but the
dinner was a great success, being baked potatoes and
fried pickerel, pressed beef and coffee, and with
dessert of toasted bread dipped in canned blueberries.</p>

<p>Before Sam and Joe showed signs of starting out,
the boys had time to fit up a stove, by digging a hole
in the top of the bank, covering it with a piece of
sheet iron, and making an entrance at right angles,
for fuel and draft.</p>

<p>It was quite a luxury to loll back, Ned against the
mass of net heaped upon the fish-box built into the
broad stern, and Hal in the narrowing bows, while
Sam and Joe sped the boat across the ripply, sparkling
river. Soon the wordy, left-handed compliments
being exchanged between Bob, on guard at
the grape arbor, and the brindled dog, on guard at
the shanty, died away in the distance, and the
eastern shore of the Mississippi came into plain
view.</p>

<p>The boat landed on a wide, shelving, sandy beach,
over which rose a line of bluffs. Hal piled ashore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
followed by Sam, but Ned stayed in the stern and
offered to “pay out” the net.</p>

<p>One end of the seine was passed to Sam, on shore;
and then Joe slowly pulled away in a great circle, the
seine dropping, fold after fold, into the water behind.
Ned held himself ready to loosen any tangle; but
there were no tangles. The net had been coiled just
right, and he was not needed.</p>

<p>It did not take long to lay the thousand foot net,
and Joe managed so well that when the circle,
marked by its slender line of round corks, was complete,
the boat was at the shore just below its former
landing place. Weighted by lead at the bottom, and
buoyed by corks at the top, the net now hung
straight down from the surface, and formed a meshy
wall.</p>

<p>Sam and Joe began to haul in, evenly and swiftly,
from one end. Yard after yard the wet weave piled
on the beach, and the circle gradually, but none the
less surely, lessened.</p>

<p>“Looks like a water-haul,” commented Joe to
Sam, scanning the water inside the circle for signs of
prisoners.</p>

<p>“Humph!” replied Sam.</p>

<p>The line of corks was now short and near, and still
there had been not a single struggle to pass them.
The surface stayed placid and smiling.</p>

<p>“Humph!” again said Sam.</p>

<p>The boys did not give up, but continued to gaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
hopefully. It did not seem possible that there was
nothing in the net.</p>

<p>However, such was the case.</p>

<p>“Water-haul!” declared Joe, finally.</p>

<p>“Humph,” repeated Sam.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed the boys, with disappointment,
eyeing the empty seine as it lay on the sand.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘water-haul’?” queried
Hal.</p>

<p>“Water’s all we got, ain’t it, sonny?” responded
Sam, sourly, throwing the net by armfuls into the
boat.</p>

<p>“I reckon we don’t try again till the moon
changes,” hinted Joe, with a sly wink at Ned. But
as Hal refused to be hoaxed into asking more questions,
after a slight pause he continued:</p>

<p>“Sam an’ me have got to go up to Newton for
provisions an’ stuff. You boys can go or you can
stay an’ we’ll take you in comin’ back.”</p>

<p>Newton was a river hamlet about two miles above.</p>

<p>“Better let ’em stay,” advised Sam, whom the
“water-haul” appeared to have made very grumpy.
“We’ve got enough to pull against the current, without
them in too.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stay, of course,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“How long will you be gone?” inquired Hal.</p>

<p>“Oh, jest for a spell,” replied Joe.</p>

<p>“Don’t you forget us,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Do you think they will?” asked Hal, growing
nervous as he watched the two fishermen row away.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” assured Ned. “Say&mdash;I tell
you what we’ll do. Let’s climb the bluffs, and while
we’re exploring we can see Sam and Joe when
they’re coming back.”</p>

<p>The river side of the bluffs had been cut away by
running water until in many places the bare limestone
was exposed, to form perpendicular cliffs. Between
these cliffs were little gullies, thickly matted
with the wild strawberry, the wild morning glory, the
violet, and a thousand other woodland plants, all
growing independent of man. Graceful and stately,
against the gray walls rose and drooped the rock
honeysuckle.</p>

<p>Eager to reach the crest, the boys scaled from foothold
to foothold, and hot and breathless, speedily
emerged upon the top. Here they stood and looked
down upon the bird’s-eye view of land and water.</p>

<p>At their feet was the beach, much reduced in size,
where they had witnessed the “water-haul.” North
and south stretched the river, a broad ribbon of blue
emblazoned with silver, and rent here and there by
islands. Beyond, directly opposite them, was the
mouth of the Monga, just above which, they knew,
was the shanty and the brindled dog, and still farther
above, the grape arbor and Bob.</p>

<p>On the hither side of the river Sam and Joe were
plainly visible, making their way, in their skiff, along
the shore line, where the shallows reduced the force
of the current.</p>

<p>“My, but this is pretty, isn’t it!” sighed Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say so!” agreed Ned. “I don’t blame
the Indians any for hating the white men who made
them give it up.”</p>

<p>The two boys strolled along the crest, sparsely
wooded with sentinel oaks, and covered with short
turf which furnished forage for a few horses.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when they came upon quite
a hole or pit, extending down through the black forest
loam into the yellow clay beneath.</p>

<p>“Why was this dug, do you suppose?” remarked
Hal.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ned, gazing into it, and pondering.</p>

<p>“There’s another,” cried Hal, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>So there was, and still another was visible, farther
on.</p>

<p>“I tell you&mdash;these are Indian mounds, and people
have been opening them to see what’s inside,” exclaimed
Ned, positively.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see much ‘mound’ about them,” objected
Hal.</p>

<p>However, a series of gentle little rises could be
made out, each with its blunt top laid open, and its
sides disfigured by heaps of dirt.</p>

<p>“What do they find in them?” asked Hal.</p>

<p>“Oh, skeletons, and arrow-heads, and things,” informed
Ned. “But you have to dig good and deep;
twenty feet, I guess.”</p>

<p>The boys scanned with a thrill of awe these relics
of a passed people who loved thus to inter their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
chiefs on some lofty outlook, commanding wood and
stream.</p>

<p>“It must have been mighty long ago,” mused Hal.
“Here’s a stump of a tree that grew right out of the
middle of one.”</p>

<p>He fell to work counting the rings.</p>

<p>“Two hundred and sixty!” he announced.</p>

<p>“Gee!” blurted Ned. “Come on,” he proposed,
after a moment which both required in order fully to
grasp the message of the stump. “Let’s poke around
inside of one, and perhaps we’ll find some arrow-heads
and stuff.”</p>

<p>He picked up a stout piece of branch, with a sharp
end, and slid down into the first pit; Hal, similarly
equipped, slid after.</p>

<p>The boys wielded their sticks well, but no trophies
resulted. Evidently the mound had been well cleaned
out, and nothing missed. They proceeded to the
next, and the next. Time sped more rapidly than
they were aware of. Suddenly Ned straightened up,
in the third mound, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Say, Hal, do you know it’s getting dark?”</p>

<p>They hastily scrambled out of the hole. Not only
was the sun low, but it was cloaked by a mass of
dense, black cloud unfolding swiftly toward the zenith.
An ominous growl of thunder rolled up the sky.
Birds were twittering uneasily, and the slight breeze
had died entirely away.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” cried Hal. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>“I bet Sam and Joe
have gone by, and we haven’t seen them!”</p>

<p>“No, they wouldn’t do that. They’d look for us,
and yell!” assured Ned, stanchly. “But we’re going
to have a big thunder-storm, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>“I wish they’d come,” murmured Hal, plaintively.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll wait until after the storm,” responded
Ned. “Anyway, we’ve got to find some
place where we can keep kind of dry, and watch the
river, too.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember that cave we saw when we
were climbing up?” asked Hal, struck with an idea.
“What’s the matter with that?”</p>

<p>Nothing was the matter with it. It was a cavity
worn out under a jutting slab of limestone&mdash;much as
though the sloping ground had fallen away at this
point. There was plenty of room to sit upright, for
some distance back in it.</p>

<p>A short time the boys sat on their roof, so to
speak, and hung their legs over the edge of the slab,
while they noted the approach of the storm. Swiftly
the cloud marched onward, foot by foot blotting out
the blue. Vivid lightning played through the billows
of heavy vapor, and the thunder pealed and mumbled.</p>

<p>Nearer came the devouring line of black. Birds
were flying for shelter. A fresh breeze sprang up,
blowing toward the advancing giant, as if he were
sucking in the air. The river, upon which appeared
not a sign of Sam and Joe, changed from silver to
dull lead frosted by a multitude of white-caps.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty grand, isn’t it!” commented Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
struck with the majesty of the storm, and with the
novelty of their plight.</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” replied Hal; who, nevertheless, preferred
to look upon the scene, however grand, from the
neighborhood of some convenient house.</p>

<p>Until the very last moment they sat here; then,
with the first spattering drops of rain, they dived for
shelter. With flare of lightning, and crackle of
thunder, and roar of wind, the rain descended in
torrents; but only a whiff of spray now and then
reached the boys, tucked in the farthermost recess
of their cave.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the rain never would abate,
for as often as it slackened, and the boys took hope,
so often it was sure to be swelled by a gust of reinforcements.
But finally it died to a drizzle, and
Ned made bold to slip out and take a survey.</p>

<p>The storm was over, practically, but the dusk of
evening was settling down in earnest.</p>

<p>“Who-oo-oo-oo-ee-ee!” shouted Ned, thinking
that perhaps Sam and Joe might be within hearing,
although he did not see any skiff.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Hal came out, and joined him in another call,
which brought no response but the echoes. Oppressed
by the dampness and the rapidly waxing
gloom, the boys felt a strange desolation.</p>

<p>“I wonder how Bob liked the storm,” spoke Ned,
trying to be cheerful. “He must have been scared!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“And all our things are just sopping! We left
our blankets out to dry, you know,” mourned
Hal.</p>

<p>“Say!” on the instant exclaimed Ned, fumbling
in his pockets. “Do you know, I left my knife up
there by one of those holes!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t find it, now,” objected Hal, who
somehow did not fancy being deserted, even for a
moment, in this weird spot.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can,” flung back Ned, scrambling up the
wet slope, and anon slipping and stumbling. “It’s
by the second hole, where I sharpened my
stick.”</p>

<p>Ned gained the crest at the same point where he
and Hal had come out when they had climbed before.
It was very still, up here; only the drip, drip,
from the trees, and the soughing of the wind, breaking
the quiet. It also was much darker and lonesomer
than he had expected it would be, but he
bravely trudged forward along the edge of the bluff
toward the old mounds.</p>

<p>He started to whistle, but his “Marching Through
Georgia” came to an abrupt stop right in the middle
of the first chorus. What uncanny, harrowing sound
was that? He halted, with one foot upraised, and
peered ahead.</p>

<p>He was nearing the first of the opened mounds,
when rising apparently out of the second he descried
a dim, white Thing, spectral, wavering, menacing him
with a series of ghastly noises.</p>

<p>The goose-flesh sprang out all over Ned’s body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
as if he had been in swimming too long, a weakness
seized on his knees, and he imagined that his hair
was rising under his battered felt hat.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that, rightfully enough, the
Indians did not approve of having their remains,
which had slumbered through two centuries and a
half, exposed by means of spades and crooked sticks
in the hands of the pale-face. And having cautiously
retreated backward, step by step, suddenly
he turned and bolted as hard as he could run! He
didn’t want his jack-knife.</p>

<p>Guided through the blackness more by guesswork
than by sight, over the edge of the bluff he plunged,
and fell, rather than ran, to the cave and the arms
of Hal.</p>

<p>Hal had heard him coming, and received him with
concern.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, what’s the matter?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;there’s something white and funny in
one of the mounds!” panted Ned. “When it saw
me coming it made a noise at me&mdash;a regular ghost-noise&mdash;and&mdash;and
I lit out.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” scoffed Hal.</p>

<p>“Well, you go up with me, and I’ll show you,”
declared Ned, indignant. “Those mounds are graves,
you know.”</p>

<p>Up he went, again, Hal readily accompanying.</p>

<p>“Listen!” whispered Ned, clutching him by the
coat sleeve, when they had reached the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Those same dreadful sounds were being borne to
them, amid the wailing of the night wind.</p>

<p>Hal caught him by the hand.</p>

<p>“Sh!” cautioned Ned; and they softly stole forward,
their heart in their mouth.</p>

<p>Yes, the white Thing was there, just as Ned had
predicted. They didn’t go very near.</p>

<p>Hal gave back a yard, and so did Ned. They
were poised, all prepared to run like deer if a hostile
movement was made against them, when from the
beach below arose to them a strenuous yodling:</p>

<p>“Oooo-dle&mdash;loo-dle&mdash;loo-dle&mdash;loo-dle!”</p>

<p>Sam and Joe! The call broke the spell.</p>

<p>“Oooo-dle&mdash;loo-dle&mdash;loo-dle&mdash;loo-dle!” yodled
the boys, fleeing as they shouted. Never had signal
been so welcome.</p>

<p>“Thought we’d left you here for good, didn’t
you?” queried Joe, when, having been piloted by
shouts and a waving lantern the boys, stumbling,
slipping, leaping, brought up beside the skiff, at the
water’s edge.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;&mdash;” hailed Ned, with scant ceremony,
“there’s some Indian graves up on the bluff, dug
open, and now it’s dark there’s a big white thing in
one of them, and we don’t know what it is.”</p>

<p>“It made an awful noise at us, and we think it’s a
ghost,” added Hal.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, I’d like to look at it,” drawled Joe. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>“I
never seen a ghost. Want to take a squint at it,
Sam?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” replied Sam. “I wouldn’t climb them
bluffs for ten thousand ghosts!”</p>

<p>Joe, lantern in hand, strode to the foot of the bluff.</p>

<p>“If it’s the genu-ine article, throw it down, an’ I’ll
pass jedgment on it,” called Sam, after him. “A
hundred foot drop won’t hurt a real ghost any, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>With Hal and Ned close at his heels Joe ascended
the steep slope, and at the top, warned by the two
boys, paused to listen.</p>

<p>“There,” whispered his companions, breathlessly,
as upon the thick air floated the mysterious sounds.</p>

<p>“By gorry, the <em>noises</em> are genu-ine, all right,” muttered
Joe, astonished, and making in the direction
whence they seemed to come.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the lantern will put it out, so he won’t
see it,” whispered Hal to Ned, vaguely suspicious that
ghosts cannot stand the light.</p>

<p>“Sh!” bade Ned.</p>

<p>However, the white thing was in the same position
as when they last had seen it. Joe never paused, but
walked right ahead, and boldly swung his lantern
forward, reckless of consequences.</p>

<p>The boys, hard behind him, fully expected to behold
some unearthly, awesome shape exposed to
view.</p>

<p>With a shock, partly of relief, partly of disappointment,
they found themselves gazing upon the protruding
eyes, inquiring ears, kindly face, and flowing
main and forelock, of a white horse, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
from his nostrils issued strange snorts of appeal and
alarm.</p>

<p>Only his head was visible above the mound. The
remainder of him was inside.</p>

<p>“Oh, gee!” exclaimed both boys, in chagrin, wishing
that they, instead of the horse, were in the hole&mdash;and
out of sight.</p>

<p>Joe doubled over in a fit of laughter that caused
him fairly to shake and wobble on his feet.</p>

<p>“Whoopee! Whoopee!” he gasped. “Nothin’ but
an old white hoss, got stuck in a hole. Or mebbe
it’s the hoss the Injun used to ride, and had buried
with him, and it’s his night to come out. P’raps to-morrer
night’ll be the Injun’s turn.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it looked like a ghost,” faltered Hal. Ned
was tongue-tied in his shame.</p>

<p>“Git out o’ here!” urged Joe, circling the animal,
and smiting him suddenly on the flank.</p>

<p>Under this sudden spur, with a grunt, a heave,
and a volley of loud snorts, the horse, awakening
from his silly lapse into helplessness, all at once
plunged and reared, and was at last again on hard
ground. Forthwith he began to graze.</p>

<p>“Now there’s room for the Injun to pop out, when
he wants to,” chuckled Joe. “Come on, you ghost-finders,
so he won’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>And, followed meekly by Hal and Ned, he returned
to the boat.</p>

<p>Oh, how Sam jeered!</p>

<p>He and Joe never forgot. And thereafter, whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
they chanced upon Hal or Ned they would be
sure to ask, slyly:</p>

<p>“Seen any ghosts lately?”</p>

<p>As if to atone for his past ill-nature, as they pulled
in at the shanty landing, Sam&mdash;who really had a very
kind heart&mdash;said, gruffly:</p>

<p>“You kids had better stop for a snack with us.
Steak an’ taters is all we got, but that grape-arbor
camp o’ yourn must be nigh drowned.”</p>

<p>The boys, with some misgivings lest Bob should
find out, and feel hurt, accepted the invitation; and
Hal frankly yielded the palm to Sam as a cook.</p>

<p>This seemed to tickle Sam more than anything
else.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, I do know how to cook, a bit,” he granted,
“seein’ as I’ve cooked for Joe an’ me for twenty odd
year.”</p>

<p>Carrying a bone which Sam sent, with his compliments,
to “the dog,” finally they arrived at their
camp. Bob wanted to know where on earth they
had been so long&mdash;but was hushed, in the midst of
his noisy remarks, by the bone.</p>

<p>The camp, as Sam had predicted, was “drowned.”
Nevertheless, the sun would repair all damage, inasmuch
as the bread, the tenderest article of food in
their cupboard, fortunately had escaped the wetting.</p>

<p>Before a huge bonfire the boys partially dried
their blankets, and then retired to the near-by horse-shed
to sleep.</p>

<p>Ere the mosquitoes had fully found them they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
were beyond annoyance, and roundly snoring, while
about their heads the little wood mice rustled through
the straw.</p>

<p>Not until morning did it occur to them that they
had not found the missing knife!</p>

<span class = "small">THE COUNTY FAIR</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">The</span> boys stayed at Rock Creek ten days.
At last they were completely out of bait;
the little marsh had been scoured clean of
frogs, and even the snakes had deserted it; every
stone and log had been overturned, for crawfish;
they had been driven to bacon-rind, which was too
hard, and to dogfish flesh, pressed beef, and bits of
bread tied in mosquito netting, all of which were too
soft. Their provisions were reduced to a few beans
and a can of peaches, and the fish in the fish-box.
Their clothing was much the worse for hard service;
so were their faces and hands.</p>

<p>They decided, suddenly, to go home.</p>

<p>Thereupon, one morning they ran their faithful
trot-lines for the last time; took them up, not
without regrets; ate an early dinner, principally
of beans and canned peaches; and by noon had
their camp broken, which was an easy matter, considering
that their blankets and their cooking utensils
were about all the outfit that had survived. They
cleaned for market the forty fish, mostly cats, imprisoned
in their fish-box, and packed them in an old
cask, with a chunk of ice, donated by Sam and Joe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
on the top under a piece of canvas. At half-past six
they were sculling to the government light on the
peninsula, with Sam and Joe waving farewell from
in front of the shanty, and with Bob, in the stern of
the boat, defiantly barking back across the water at
the brindled dog, and telling him what he (Bob)
would have done had he (Bob) remained only a day
longer.</p>

<p>Soon the <cite>Harriett</cite> hove in sight around the bend
below, and swinging in at their bandanna handkerchief
signal, stopped for them to hustle aboard.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock they were at Beaufort, and had
astonished Commodore Jones by lugging their cask
of fish upon his quarter-deck&mdash;that is, his fish-market
platform&mdash;and demanding payment.</p>

<p>As a result of the bargain, they came out gainers
fifty cents each, over and above their passage money
both ways on the <em>Harriett!</em></p>

<p>The first half of the long vacation was now gone,
and what with swimming and baseball and short
jaunts after sunfish and croppies, and other amusements
furnished by field and river, the last half also
quickly passed.</p>

<p>As a glorious wind-up to the Beaufort youths’
summer of fun, with the closing week of vacation
came the county fair. This was an annual event,
and was held on grounds maintained for the purpose
upon the outskirts of the town; and year to year
Beaufort people, old as well as young, looked forward
to it with much interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned went, of course. And this year Bob went,
too. It was his burning ambition to go everywhere
that Ned did; and in the case of school and church,
this created some embarrassment.</p>

<p>Considering that probably it was his first fair, and
that there were numerous temptations in the shape
of fat pigs with ears delicious to bite, and cows and
sheep just prime to be chased, and countless farmers’
dogs ripe to be taught town manners, he behaved
very well indeed.</p>

<p>He and Ned covered the entire exhibition. They
did not miss a single item, although there were a
number of things for which they did not care a bit.
They inspected the live-stock pens (where the pigs
and cattle nearly drove Bob to distraction); they
traversed machinery hall, and poultry hall, and all
the other halls; and in particular they explored the
hall of arts. Here, worming their way through the
crowd they gazed with watering mouth&mdash;at least,
Ned’s mouth watered, and Bob’s still dripped in
memory of the porkine ears elsewhere&mdash;upon
strained honey, and rich cheeses, and jellies and
preserves and cakes and doughnuts and cookies
and other marvels into which ambitious good-wives
had put their whole hearts. Ned sought
this building several times; he had vague hopes
that in some way he might encounter the judging
committee, and be invited to help “taste.”</p>

<p>A close second in interest to this display was that
of floral hall, where the flowers themselves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
rivaled in hues by apples and peaches and plums
and cherries and pears and grapes, in luscious
pyramids.</p>

<p>These two halls were extraordinary places for getting
up an appetite!</p>

<p>However, one did not need to depend upon the
stock pens and the various “halls” for one’s entertainment.
Outside there was endless variety, and
the air was constantly athrill with excitement. All
day a throng of shows in tents did a loud and urgent
business, inviting the people far and near by
banjo and gong and word of mouth to come in and
see snakes and wild men and bearded women and
giants and dwarfs, and the like, whose wondrous
figures were outlined in gay colors upon the canvas
without. These shows formed a long street, lined
with the pictured marvels, and alive with shouts of:</p>

<p>“Hi yi yi yi! Walk in, walk in! Great free
show, only ten cents, half a dime!”</p>

<p>“Right this way! Everybody! Come everybody!
Biggest show for the money in the world!”</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop! Stop! Don’t miss it! We are
the people! A whole circus for only ten cents!”</p>

<p>Every morning there was a parade around the race
track of prize-winning animals, where horses pranced,
bulls roared defiantly, and donkeys brayed and
kicked.</p>

<p>Every afternoon at one o’clock there was a balloon
ascension; and at two o’clock began trotting and
running races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Not to miss anything on the fair grounds kept a
boy and dog hustling, although they went every day&mdash;which
they didn’t. Still, by virtue of the addition
to his funds of that fifty cents fish money, Ned managed
to go oftener than in any previous year.</p>

<p>Most fascinating was the balloon ascension. All
through the morning the balloon lay, a mass of inert,
dirty, rubbery cloth, on the ground at the spot
whence the ascent was to be made. It always was
surrounded by curious people, who looked upon it
with awe, but who were kept from fingering it by a
rope staked about it.</p>

<p>A little after twelve the program of filling it with
gas began. Slowly the dull heap inflated, until no
longer was it inert; it swayed and struggled, instinct
with life.</p>

<p>The aeronaut, arrayed in tights of pink, with a
spangled sash about his waist, came out from a little
tent, and while all eyes scanned him admiringly, inspected
the progress of the work. He was a slender,
alert man, with a tawny moustache, and keen glance.
Finally the balloon towered like a gigantic pear over
the heads of the throng, and strained to be free. It
was held by a single rope, passing over the top, one
end tied to a stout stick and the other held by sturdy
assistants. The rope made a crease in the bulging,
puffy dome.</p>

<p>Suddenly the aeronaut, having tested certain fastenings
and knots, commanded sharply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let go!”</p>

<p>The persons holding the rope released it. It
slipped over the top. Amid shrill cheers and the
hum of voices the balloon darted upward, dragging
after it a trapeze, and there, below the trapeze, was
the aeronaut, hanging by a slender cord. Up the
cord he nimbly climbed, like a monkey, and sitting
upon the bar of the trapeze, while the balloon continued
its dizzy flight, kissed his hand to the gazing
multitude beneath. Then he performed a number of
acrobatic feats, and later lit somewhere, balloon and
all, to appear and repeat the program the next day.</p>

<p>Ned wondered how it felt. He was soon to find
out.</p>

<p>From the first he had simply burned to catch hold
of the rope, and help keep the balloon down. But
other boys who had volunteered had been roughly
rejected by the aeronaut, so Ned could only push as
near as possible, and be all ready.</p>

<p>It was the closing day of the fair, and the last of
the ascensions was about to occur. The balloon was
filled and buoyant, and a fresh breeze was causing it
to tug unusually at the one rope. The men holding
the rope down were almost lifted, at times, off their
feet. It was a tug of war between the balloon and
them, and the balloon seemed likely to have the best
of it.</p>

<p>“Here, you people; some of you give us a hand
on that rope, will you?” appealed the aeronaut.</p>

<p>At least half a score&mdash;many more than were
needed&mdash;sprang over into the enclosure; among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
them were Ned and Bob. Only three or four could
find room on the rope&mdash;and among these was Ned.
Thus, at length, he was where he had wanted to be.</p>

<p>The aeronaut was too busy to pay any attention.</p>

<p>“Now&mdash;let go!” he ordered, suddenly.</p>

<p>As the words were leaving his mouth, this is what
happened: Wrenched by a sudden fierce gust of wind
the stake to which the balloon was anchored was torn
from the earth; the people who had been braced at
the other end of the rope sat down hard. The balloon
jumped, and the heavy stake, swinging inward,
caught in the netting; the rope, quickly kinking,
knotted under Ned’s shoulders as he sprawled, for a
moment, on the ground; and like lightning he was
jerked into space.</p>

<p>The accident took only a second. Now Ned was
valiantly set, prepared to hold the balloon all by himself,
if necessary; next, he was lifted irresistibly, helplessly,
into the air, and out of a great uproar of voices
he was conscious only of Bob’s despairing, high-pitched
yelps, quickly fading away, beneath; and
above, the aeronaut’s imperative, tense voice:</p>

<p>“Hang tight! Grab the rope!”</p>

<p>With both hands Ned had at once gripped the
rope as high as he could reach. It was wound about
his chest, and the free end dangled below. He
raised his eyes, and there, over head on the trapeze,
was the aeronaut.</p>

<p>“Get that end between your legs&mdash;that’s right,”
bade the aeronaut. “Can you hold on?”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Y-y-yes,” quavered Ned, for he was badly frightened,
and between the queer sensation of the bottom
dropping out of everything, and the pressure of the
rope about him, he was nearly breathless.</p>

<p>“You’re all hunky, then,” said the aeronaut,
cheerily. “In a jiffy we’ll be back. You can’t fall;
just hang on and wait.”</p>

<p>“Y-y-yes,” quavered Ned, feeling like a spider on
a thread.</p>

<p>It was very still where they were. He heard a
faint hissing, and he wondered what it was. The
aeronaut had opened the escape valve in the balloon.
Ned did not know it, but they were descending.</p>

<p>“How do you like your free ride?” queried the
aeronaut, noting Ned’s drawn face, and trying to
divert him from thinking on the peril of the situation.</p>

<p>“P-pretty w-well,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Don’t look down! Look at me!” commanded
the aeronaut, sternly. “Look at me or I’ll drop on
top of you,” he repeated.</p>

<p>Ned, alarmed, kept his eyes glued on those pink-clad
legs twenty feet above him.</p>

<p>Yet he could no more help glancing hurriedly beneath
him, than after a tooth has come out can you
help putting your tongue into the hole.</p>

<p>He looked down for just a fraction of a second&mdash;and
it was enough. He had seen the world, laid flat;
a patch of green, and a patch of yellow, and a thread-like
streak of silver; and the gulf that yawned under
him made his flesh creep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Supposing the aeronaut should drop on him!
Wouldn’t that be awful! The rope might break, and
together they would whirl like stones down through
space. He watched the aeronaut anxiously.</p>

<p>“That’s right&mdash;watch me,” said the aeronaut. “If
you don’t&mdash;&mdash;” And he shook his head meaningly.</p>

<p>All this had required but a few moments, yet to
Ned they had seemed hours.</p>

<p>“Where would you like to land?” asked the aeronaut,
in a chatty voice. “Back at the fair grounds,
or in a corn-field?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” faltered Ned. He was getting tired
of his strained position.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ll choose the corn-field this trip,”
decided the aeronaut&mdash;speaking as if they were used
to taking such hazardous rides together. “Now, listen
here,” he continued, sharply. “We’re getting
close to the ground. Hear the leaves rustling?
Look down if you want to, and see. Didn’t I tell
you? Pretty soon you’ll be touching the top of the
corn. Then I’m going to cut your rope with my
knife. It won’t hurt you to drop&mdash;you’ve often
jumped out of trees and things higher than we’ll be&mdash;of
course you have.”</p>

<p>How near the ground was! Ned could scarcely
believe his eyes. It seemed to be rushing up at
them. Below was a large corn-field, the stiff stalks
bending in the breeze.</p>

<p>“When I say ‘three,’ I’ll cut,” warned the aeronaut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” responded Ned.</p>

<p>The corn stalks just scraped his toes. The aeronaut
put his knife against the rope.</p>

<p>“One&mdash;two&mdash;three!” he cried.</p>

<p>Ned dropped. Crash, crash, thump! He ploughed
through the corn, and brought up with his hands
buried to the wrists in dirt. But he was safe on
earth! Rather, he was safe <em>in</em> earth! It didn’t matter;
he was thankful.</p>

<p>Without delaying to unwind the rope, he started
to stand up to look for the balloon and the aeronaut.
He caught just a glimpse of them, already careening
onward, far adown the field, where they had darted
when relieved of his weight&mdash;and then he sank back
with an “Ouch!”</p>

<p>He had sprained his ankle.</p>

<p>He unwrapped the rope, and carrying it in his
hand hobbled toward the road. The aeronaut, who
had made a better landing a quarter of a mile away,
came rattling up, balloon and all, in a farmer’s wagon,
to meet him.</p>

<p>Then they made triumphal entry into town, and
Mrs. Miller, astonished at seeing the turn-out stop
before her door, learned what a thrilling ride aloft
Ned had just made.</p>

<p>First she hugged him, and then she bound his
ankle, and then she hugged him again, and then she
went off to cry. But she couldn’t stay, and came
back with tears still in her eyes.</p>

<p>Next Mr. Miller arrived in haste, and after patting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Ned softly on the head, and saying: “Why, Neddie!”
coughed violently, and had to turn his back
and blow his nose.</p>

<p>Last came Bob, trotting home in great chagrin
over having lost track of his master. He stood on
his hind legs, and licked Ned all over the face.</p>

<p>Ned was considered very lucky&mdash;by older folks
because he had escaped with his life; by the boys
because he had been up in a balloon; and by himself
because the sprain had come at the end of vacation,
instead of at the beginning or middle.</p>

<span class = "small">NED THE NIMROD</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Ned’s</span> ankle healed all too rapidly, for <em>him;</em>
he was out of school only three days. However,
it remained weak for a much longer
time, affording him the fun of limping about with a
cane. The boys quite envied him, and the girls gazed
on him with mingled symptoms of awe and pity.</p>

<p>Little Zu-zu Pearce, who, since his rescue of Tom,
had adopted him as her own especial hero, came up
to him, as he was standing by the schoolhouse steps,
and looking at him gravely, said:</p>

<p>“Does it hurt you awful, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” scoffed Ned. “It’s nothing but just a
common sprain, and it’s about well, now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’d say, even if it was killing
you,” asserted Zu-zu, admiringly. “And you were
awful brave not to let go of that rope and be
killed!”</p>

<p>“Aw, I couldn’t have let go if I’d tried,” asserted
Ned, wriggling uneasily. “I was tied on.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care&mdash;you <em>didn’t</em> let go, anyway,”
returned Zu-zu; and she skipped back to the other
girls, leaving Ned red and embarrassed, but nevertheless
gazing after her with a pleased expression in his
eyes and a kindly warmth in his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>But, as in the case of many a badge of honor, the
cane presently became irksome. Ned wanted a gun,
and he knew that it was no use to aspire to be a
hunter if he couldn’t walk and run. So he dropped
the cane, now unnecessary, and fell to teasing his
father for a shotgun.</p>

<p>Living as they did beside the Mississippi, which is
a great thoroughfare for wild fowl in their flights
from north to south, and from south to north, each
fall and spring the Beauforters were given splendid
duck-shooting.</p>

<p>All the men who liked hunting, and nearly all the
older boys, and some of the younger whose folks
did not care, had guns. Hunting played as important
a part in a Beaufort boy’s program as did swimming
and rowing.</p>

<p>Although Ned had mastered the two sports last
mentioned, it did not seem to his mother that she
ever could consent to his taking up the first&mdash;hunting
with a gun.</p>

<p>Time had proved to her that there were plenty of
dangers to which Ned was exposed, without adding to
the list powder and lead.</p>

<p>Ned argued for; his mother pleaded against;
Mr. Miller listened and smiled, and was strictly non-committal.
Down deep in his mind he knew that in
the end Ned would win the day.</p>

<p>“Well, Helen, I don’t see but what we’ll have to
give the boy the gun,” he remarked to his wife, when
they were alone, one evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Will!” groaned Mrs. Miller, in piteous
tones.</p>

<p>“But you see, my dear, it will be very hard to
keep him from being with other boys who have
guns,” explained her husband, “and it would be
better to let him have a gun of his own, and understand
how to use it, than to leave him to pick up
what he can, and maybe get injured through his
ignorance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Will!” again appealed Mrs. Miller. “It
doesn’t seem as though I <em>could</em> agree to it.”</p>

<p>Then mother-like, that her boy might live his
strong, sturdy life, she consented.</p>

<p>“Ned,” spoke Mr. Miller, the next noon, “supposing
we let you have a gun, will you promise to
do exactly as we say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” agreed Ned, promptly.</p>

<p>“And you’ll be careful?” implored his mother,
anxiously gazing at him.</p>

<p>“Of course,” assured Ned.</p>

<p>He half-way expected that his father would take
him straight down town and buy a gun; but he was
disappointed. There were farther preliminaries.</p>

<p>“All right,” said his father. “But before you get
the gun, I want to be sure that you know how to
handle it. I don’t want you shooting yourself, or
shooting anybody else, which would be about as bad.
So I’ve arranged with Mr. Russell to take you out
and show you a few things.”</p>

<p>Mr. Russell lived across the street. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
great hunter, and had all manner of shooting stuff.
He was known as a very steady, prudent man, and
Mr. and Mrs. Miller felt that they could safely trust
Ned to him.</p>

<p>As for Ned, his disappointment was not keen,
after all. Going out with Mr. Russell, whom he regarded
as the finest hunter in town, was next best
thing to having a gun, oneself.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;&mdash;” he began, his face aglow.</p>

<p>“Ned!” rebuked his mother.</p>

<p>“I mean&mdash;when are we going?” resumed Ned,
too excited to offer other apology. “And will he
help me train Bob to be a hunting dog?”</p>

<p>“He’ll let you know when he’s ready,” stated Mr.
Miller. “And until then you must wait, and not
bother either him or us, about gun or dog.”</p>

<p>Ned strove to walk his paths with patience, and
soon was rewarded. The twentieth of September,
and the first frost had just passed, and hazelnuts
and hickory-nuts were ripe for gathering, when Mr.
Russell sent over word for Ned to be ready that
night after school, and they would go out for a little
while.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Ned, capering through the
sitting-room. “Did he say to take a lunch, father?
Will you put it up, mother? How long are we to
stay? Where are we going? Can I stay as long as
he does?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Neddie!” protested his mother, placing her
hands over her ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ned, be still!” ordered his father. “I don’t
think you’ll need a lunch&mdash;although, judging from
your appetite, you ought to carry one with you all
the time. No, Mr. Russell said that he was merely
going out on the flats for an hour, to shoot off some
old shells, and that you could help him, if you
liked.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” responded Ned, a bit crestfallen. “Shall
I take Bob?”</p>

<p>“If neither Mr. Russell nor Bob objects, I’m sure
I don’t,” laughed Mr. Miller.</p>

<p>As soon as school was out Ned scurried to Mr.
Russell’s, and found him sorting over shells, and
stuffing some into his coat pockets. Ned was a
little surprised to note that he was dressed just as
usual, and evidently did not intend to wear his business-like
hunting coat, with its stains from game and
weather, and its pockets with here and there a mysterious
feather; or his boots; or even his brown cap
with slanting visor.</p>

<p>“Hello, young man,” greeted Mr. Russell.</p>

<p>“Hello,” replied Ned. “Are we going to kill
anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing except some cans and chunks of wood,
I guess,” responded Mr. Russell.</p>

<p>“Do you want Bob?” queried Ned, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Why, yes; take him along, if you wish to,” answered
Mr. Russell, surveying Bob, who was wagging
his tail near by. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>“He’s pretty old to train, now,
but we can see if there’s any good in him, maybe.”</p>

<p>Bob, who, at the stroke of the bell for the close
of school always hied out upon the front walk to
wait for his master, and thus, this afternoon, had
caught him ere he entered the Russell gate, had
been uneasily sniffing at the gun case, and eyeing
Mr. Russell’s preparations. He whined, vaguely
and uncertainly. There was something that he didn’t
like.</p>

<p>In spite of Mr. Russell’s ordinary garb Ned was
as proud as a peacock when they started up the
street together, while Bob, with worried air, trotted
behind.</p>

<p>The flats for which they were bound lay just west
of the town; they were a wide stretch of low, level
land, pasture and shallow marsh, given over to cows
and frogs.</p>

<p>Ned and Mr. Russell scrambled over a fence, and
stopped in a field where there were no cattle or persons
within range.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell took the gun from its case, and
snapped it together.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;is that your gun?” demanded Ned, surprised.
“I thought you had a double-barrel!”</p>

<p>“This is a new one,” replied Mr. Russell. “See,
how it comes apart?” and he unsnapped the fore-end,
and took off the barrel. “Now you try,” he
bade, passing the parts to Ned.</p>

<p>Without hesitation Ned fitted them together.
Then he handled the piece fondly.</p>

<p>It was a compact little single-barrel, twelve-bore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with low, rebounding hammer, pistol grip, barrel of
bronzed twist, stock of polished walnut, and all the
metal trimmings blued, to prevent rust, and avoid
alarming game by flashes of sun; in fact, from the
sight bead to the rubber butt plate it seemed a perfect
little gun.</p>

<p>“My!” sighed Ned, boldly putting it to his
shoulder, and aiming into space. “It is choke-bore,
Mr. Russell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, siree,” assured Mr. Russell, who had been
watching him with a twinkle in his eyes. “Shall I
show you?” and he extended his hand.</p>

<p>With a final loving pat of the breech Ned regretfully
turned the gun over to him, and awaited the
next number on the program.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell inserted a shell, and said:</p>

<p>“Now go off from me about thirty yards, and
throw up this tin can, and let’s see what I can do to it.”</p>

<p>Ned obeyed. He ran out, close followed by Bob,
until Mr. Russell told him to stop.</p>

<p>“Throw it high, and away from you,” called Mr.
Russell.</p>

<p>Up sailed the can. “Bang!” went the gun.
“Clink!” sounded the shot cutting the tin. The
can jumped in its arc, and striking the ground
rolled over and over as though it had been mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>Ned raced to pick it up. It was now a sorry looking
can; and he brought it to Mr. Russell, counting
the shot holes as he did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sixteen!” he announced, triumphantly, giving it
over for inspection.</p>

<p>“That’s very fair,” commented Mr. Russell, carelessly
glancing at it. “There goes your dog,” he
added, pointing across the field.</p>

<p>Sure enough; there was Bob, two hundred yards
away, and making a bee-line for home. He never
looked back. His tail was between his legs and his
back was humped, and even at that distance his
whole mien told of outraged feelings.</p>

<p>“Here, Bob! Here, Bob!” called Ned; but he
called and whistled in vain.</p>

<p>“No use, Ned,” remarked Mr. Russell, laughing.
“He’s gun-shy. Somebody must have shot at him,
once; or fired off a gun close to his ears; and now,
you see, he’s afraid when he hears a report.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he get over it?” asked Ned, astonished
and puzzled.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think he will,” answered Mr. Russell.
“He’s spoiled for hunting.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ned, gazing after poor Bob, now a
speck townward. “It isn’t his fault, anyway. He
can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Supposing you try a shot,” proposed Mr. Russell,
handing the gun and a shell to him.</p>

<p>Bob’s failure to toe the scratch, in this, the only
particular, vanished from Ned’s mind. He gladly
seized gun and shell.</p>

<p>“No, that’s not the right way to put in a cartridge,”
corrected Mr. Russell, kindly. “You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the muzzle pointed exactly at my stomach! And
when you close the breech, that will bring the muzzle
about at my mouth! Let me show you a better
way.”</p>

<p>“There!” he continued, returning the weapon to
Ned. “When you load, always be sure that nobody
is in line with the piece. The chances are that the
shell won’t explode, but if it should, even once in a
thousand times, or in ten thousand, and there be an
accident, you’d never forgive yourself. It’s impossible
to be too cautious, and it’s very easy not to be
cautious enough, Ned.”</p>

<p>Ned, somewhat abashed, but impressed by the
earnestness of Mr. Russell’s voice, this time loaded
more carefully, and Mr. Russell had him repeat
the operation to make certain that the lesson was
learned.</p>

<p>“One small mistake might ruin your whole life,
Ned,” warned Mr. Russell. “So start right. And
now for a mark,” he proceeded. “I’ll set a can on
that fence post, yonder, and I’ll wager that you can’t
put as many shot in it as I did in that other can on
the fly. Did you ever shoot a gun?”</p>

<p>“Once,” confessed Ned, reluctantly. “A long
time ago. And it kicked me over, and made my lip
bleed, and when I came home, and father found out
he said it served me right. It was Chuck Donahue’s;
his big muzzle loader.”</p>

<p>“Did you hit anything?” queried Mr. Russell,
smiling as he walked away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-n-no,” admitted Ned. “At least, there was
only one shot-hole, and Chuck said he made it. But
I’ve aimed lots of times,” he added, to prove that he
was not lacking in experience.</p>

<p>“Here!” called Mr. Russell, looking back. “Keep
that gun pointed toward the ground until you’re taking
aim! I don’t want to be speckled all over with
lead.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t cocked,” explained Ned.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference,” retorted Mr. Russell.
“Always handle a gun, empty or loaded, cocked or
not, as though you expected that it would go off at
any moment. That should become a fixed habit.
Will you remember&mdash;or shall we stop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll remember,” pledged Ned.</p>

<p>And, barring a few slight lapses, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell balanced the smooth round can on the
fence post, and walked to one side.</p>

<p>“All ready,” he announced.</p>

<p>Ned leveled the piece, and pulled on the trigger.
He couldn’t budge it.</p>

<p>“Why not cock your gun?” inquired Mr. Russell,
quizzically.</p>

<p>Ned blushed. What a number of blunders he had
made! Mr. Russell would think him very stupid.</p>

<p>He aimed again.</p>

<p>“Bang!”</p>

<p>The stock of the gun flew up and jarred his head,
but he didn’t mind. He peered through the thin
smoke. The can had disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hit it! I hit it! I know I hit it!” he cried,
setting out on the dead run.</p>

<p>“I should say you did!” assured Mr. Russell, delighted,
picking up the can and examining it.
“Bravo! Fifteen&mdash;sixteen, seventeen! You beat
me by one!”</p>

<p>Ned clutched the can, and delivered the gun into
cooler keeping. He scanned his trophy inch by
inch, and gloated over the many holes. Mr. Russell
noted his puffed lip, and smiled.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t taken in me, too, when you swung
your gun, to aim,” he commented, “you might not
have been punished by that lip.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” uttered Ned, a little taken aback, and becoming
conscious of his bump.</p>

<p>“Next time you’ll hold the gun tighter against
your shoulder&mdash;and be more careful in that other respect,
too,” said Mr. Russell, simply.</p>

<p>They stayed on the flats for an hour and a half,
and used up all of Mr. Russell’s cartridges; and when
Ned went home he fairly was bursting with information.
He carried with him that riddled tin can, and
with no small degree of pride showed it to the family
and to the boys of the neighborhood. He had hit
other cans, during the lesson, but this was the result
of his first shot!</p>

<p>Bob was waiting for him, at the front gate. He
greeted his master with a sheepish, apologetic manner,
as though to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to act so silly; but you know, I
can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Bob,” comforted Ned. “I understand.
You shan’t go again.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Bob whined wistfully, as much as to say:</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think you ought to go, then, either.”</p>

<p>Bob, you see, was just a mite selfish in regard to
Ned.</p>

<p>During the next week Ned went out several times
with Mr. Russell, and began to feel like quite a veteran.
He not only could hit stationary cans, but he
learned to hit things tossed into the air. To tell the
truth, he was a fine pupil.</p>

<p>“Ned, Mr. Russell thinks that the public won’t
suffer if we go ahead now and trust you alone with a
gun,” observed Mr. Miller, one evening, at the supper
table. “He says you’re learning well, and that all
you need do is remember.”</p>

<p>“I can hit a little piece of bark thrown up forty
yards away,” asserted Ned, confidently.</p>

<p>“Very good,” responded his father, pushing back
from the table. “But I didn’t get Mr. Russell to
teach you that, so much as to teach you <em>not</em> to hit
some objects more important!”</p>

<p>He went into the bedroom, and came back, bearing
a gun case.</p>

<p>“How do you like it?” he said, giving it to Ned.</p>

<p>With feverish fingers Ned unbuckled the straps.
The case had looked familiar; the gun was still
more familiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say&mdash;&mdash;” he burst out. “Is it mine? Did Mr.
Russell give it to me? Did you buy it of him?
It’s the very same gun!”</p>

<p>“So it is,” replied his father, pleased to see <em>him</em> so
pleased. “I had Mr. Russell pick it out for me the
day after you and your mother and I talked together;
so you’ve been using it all this time, and
now you’re acquainted with it. It’s yours.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” interrupted Mrs. Miller. “Wait a moment.
Give the gun to me, Ned.”</p>

<p>Ned wonderingly surrendered the treasure.</p>

<p>“Neddie,” she declared, holding it behind her
back, and trying not to laugh, “you can’t have it
unless you promise not to use that dreadful ‘say’ any
more!”</p>

<p>“I won’t, I won’t!” vowed Ned, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Won’t what?” insisted his mother.</p>

<p>“Won’t say ‘say’ any more,” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Or as much,” restricted his mother, firmly.</p>

<p>“I won’t say it at all,” promised Ned.</p>

<p>With a kiss his mother restored the gun to his
eager grasp.</p>

<p>The only personage within Ned’s circle of relatives
and friends who did not rejoice with him in his new
gun was Bob. Poor Bob! The weapon was an
eye-sore to him. When his master brought it out
Bob gazed at him reproachfully, and slunk off, dejected,
woebegone. No coaxing could lift his
spirits, or induce him to come outside the yard,
when the gun was in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The gun was the only break that ever occurred in
the relationship between Ned and his dog.</p>

<p>Ned speedily waxed to be a crack shot among his fellows.
He practiced incessantly, to the death of countless
tin cans, and the disappearance of his savings.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller did not object, but he outlined his
views in a little lecture on shooting in general.</p>

<p>“Destroy all the cans you want to, Ned,” he
laughed. “They’re fair game.” Then he grew
graver: “That’s right. I want you to learn to
shoot straight, so as to kill when you intend to.
But don’t shoot for practice at innocent birds. They
love to live, as well as you. Don’t risk shots at
game when the chances are that you can merely
wound. Shoot straight, and kill outright. Better
let a duck go, than maim it, so that it is liable to
linger and suffer for hours or days. That is why I
gave you a single-barrel, and had it heavily choked.
You will be more careful than if you had a second
barrel to fall back upon, and when the load hits a
bird, it will hit to kill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Neddie! I do wish that you would be content
to shoot at cans and such things, like you are
doing now,” pleaded his mother.</p>

<p>“Why, mother!” exclaimed Ned, horrified. “We
can’t eat <em>cans!</em>”</p>

<p>“So far as eating is concerned, Ned,” spoke his
father, drily, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>“we shan’t go back on our butcher
just yet, even though you <em>have</em> got a gun! We
might need him.”</p>

<p>Of all the boys who accompanied Ned, to throw
cans and blocks about at his bidding, Tom Pearce
was the most faithful, although Hal likewise went
quite often, and was trying to have his father get
him a gun, also.</p>

<p>The frosty nights and the soft, delicious days of
Indian summer arrived; with them arrived the ducks,
who well knew that winter was near at hand, in ambush
on the borders of autumn.</p>

<p>Ned’s neck was stiff from perpetually searching
the heavens to discover scurrying flocks. He talked
ducks from morn to eve, and dreamed ducks from
eve to morn, and the family assured him that he
certainly would turn into one, if he didn’t let up.</p>

<p>And so far, despite his hunting excursions, and
his tales of “big mallards” that he “almost” got,
the family table was still innocent of game.</p>

<p>The tenth of November, and behold Ned, and
Tom, his squire, across the river, trudging among
the winding sloughs that formed a popular Beaufort
hunting-ground. They had started from home at
four in the morning&mdash;as was their custom; and had
been tramping ever since&mdash;as, again, was their
custom; and had not shot a single duck&mdash;which,
alas, also was their custom. Ducks were much more
crafty than tin cans.</p>

<p>Yet the boys thought that tramping all a long day,
laden with gun and shells and boots, through swamp
and over fields; with a few mouthfuls of cold breakfast,
and a cold lunch hastily gobbled; and at the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>last not a feather to reward them, was much less
work than piling wood, for instance, or going down
town for a yeast-cake!</p>

<p>Perseverance has its reward. On this tenth of
November Ned and Tom had stopped in a fence
corner to eat their lunch, which consisted mainly
of bread and butter and sugar, hard boiled eggs, and
cookies. They had stiffly arisen, and had walked
forward not twenty paces, when up from under the
high bank of a narrow inlet just in front of them,
jumped straight into the air, with a quack and a
sputter, a panic-stricken something, and was off like
a bullet.</p>

<p>“Ned!” blurted Tom.</p>

<p>“Bang!” spoke the gun.</p>

<p>Down to turf upon the other side of the inlet
plumped the something, magically stopped in mid-flight.</p>

<p>“You got him! You got him! Hurrah!”
howled Tom, dashing through the water, up over
his knees&mdash;and boots.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered Ned, in his wake.</p>

<p>It had happened so quickly that he was quite beside
himself. He had no recollection of taking aim.
He had no recollection of anything save a feathered
blurr in the air, his gun banging&mdash;and the feathered
blurr had disappeared.</p>

<p>Through the shallow inlet they plashed, reckless
of consequences. On the way Ned ejected the
empty shell and inserted, with trembling fingers, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
new one, to be ready in case the victim should suddenly
make off!</p>

<p>The precaution was unnecessary. The victim was
past all “making off.” Tom reached it first, where
it lay, a shapeless, pathetic little lump of down and
quill, twenty yards from the water’s edge, and grabbed
it with the zeal of a retriever.</p>

<p>“It’s a wood-duck!” he cried, joyfully.</p>

<p>Ned panted up, and with scant courtesy snatched
it from him.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t, either,” he said, scornfully. “It’s a green-wing
teal. See there.”</p>

<p>Tom meekly granted the correction as coming
from one who owned a new gun and must know.</p>

<p>The boys turned the limp bunch&mdash;no larger than
a pigeon, but, nevertheless, their first prize&mdash;over and
over in their hands, marking its every feature.</p>

<p>Unlucky duckling; its life, begun only that summer,
had quickly ended.</p>

<p>At last Ned tucked it in the pocket of his hunting-coat,
and on they strode, feeling now on the
highway to slaughter.</p>

<p>Every few minutes Ned caressingly fingered the
warm, soft ball hanging against his left hip. He
hoped that it would make a bloody spot on the
canvas of the pocket. Although he had done his
best, the coat was still altogether too fresh.</p>

<p>No more game fell to his gun that day; but
neither he nor Tom cared. They were not to go
home empty-handed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>All the way through the streets Ned wondered if
people suspected what he was carrying concealed in
that pocket; and he bore, without caring, the gibes of
sundry hateful urchins:</p>

<p>“Aw, didn’t get nothin’! Didn’t get nothin’!
Ain’t he a big hunter, though!”</p>

<p>Tom stayed and helped him clean the teal. They
sat in the barn door, and scattered the feathers into
the alley, while Bob sniffed and sniffed at their operations.
The smell of the duck seemed to revive in his
blood old instincts, inherited from his parents, and he
was unhappy and puzzled.</p>

<p>“You didn’t kill that all at once, did you?”
laughed a man, driving past.</p>

<p>Well, it had not been very big, with the feathers
on, and it was very much smaller, with the feathers
off. But it was a duck!</p>

<p>The boys counted the shot-holes, and traced where
each pellet had gone in and come out. They agreed
that Ned’s aim had been exactly right and that the
gun was a wonder.</p>

<p>Into the midst of their pleasure crept an undercurrent
of pity which stopped just short of regret.</p>

<p>“Seems kind of too bad, to kill it, doesn’t it,”
commented Tom, weighing the wee, cold, bare
morsel in his palm.</p>

<p>“Y-y-yes,” admitted Ned. “But I guess he never
knew what struck him.”</p>

<p>The wings, with their band of shiny emerald, had
been put aside, to keep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here,” said Ned, holding them out to Tom, as
that stanch follower was on the point of going home.
“Take ’em.”</p>

<p>“No, you keep ’em,” insisted Tom.</p>

<p>“Give ’em to Zu-zu, then,” blushed Ned, as if that
was a second thought. “She can wear ’em in a
hat.”</p>

<p>Ned was duly congratulated on his success by the
family. The duck went to the ice-box, and was
roasted and served to him for dinner the next day.</p>

<p>“Oh, Neddie!” exclaimed his mother, as the teal,
now, after cooking, was smaller than ever. “Do you
mean to say that it took two boys and a gun and
nearly a whole day to kill a poor little bird like
that?”</p>

<p>“It’s good, anyway,” excused Ned, his mouth
full.</p>

<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">But</span> this fall, gun and duck did not stand as the
only excitement for Ned and the other Beaufort
youth. Politics were red hot. A president
and vice-president of the United States were to
be elected, and the town was in a perfect ferment day
and night.</p>

<p>There were caucuses and parades and “rallies”
and sidewalk discussions and even fights, in all
of which the boys, and the girls, too, took lively
interest.</p>

<p>At school the recesses were given over, for the
most part, to debate. Ned’s father was a Republican,
Ned was what his father was, and Bob was what Ned
was; Mr. Lucas was a Democrat, therefore Hal was
a Democrat; Tom had no father living, and so he
sided with neither cause, but said that he “didn’t
care.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the Republicans claimed the best of
the argument.</p>

<p>Nobody in Beaufort was more faithful in attending
the various political meetings than was Ned.
With eyes and ears alert he sedately accompanied
his father; or else, doing as he pleased, tagged the
band about through the streets until it brought up
at hall or opera house. He sat or stood, squeezed
in, the whole evening through, listening to orators
declare what great and wise things their party had
done, and what mean and foolish things the other
parties had done. In case it was a Republican meeting
he cheered in triumph; in case it was the opposition
(for he did not limit himself to the one) he
cheered “just for fun.” Thus he was able to do lots
of shouting, and went home hot, hoarse, and full of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Of all the meetings in the town during the campaign,
the crowning one occurred as follows:</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Mr. Miller, glancing over
<cite>The Evening Clarion</cite>.</p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired his wife, while Ned, hovering
near, was at once all ears.</p>

<p>“Why, I see by <cite>The Clarion</cite> that Senator Lipp is
to be here on the twenty-ninth, and we’re going to
have the biggest Republican rally ever held in the
county,” explained her husband.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;&mdash;” cried Ned, agog, and forgetful of his
recent promise.</p>

<p>“Gun!” said his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean to. It slipped out before I
thought,” excused Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let it slip in again,” laughed his
mother.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a big parade around the town, winding
up at the opera house,” continued Mr. Miller,
skimming through the article. “All the outside
places are to be invited to send marching clubs. It’s
the last rally before election, and it will be a
whooper.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father! I want to march! Can I?” begged
Ned.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied his father, unexpectedly.
“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“But I mean march in the parade,” persisted Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” responded his father.</p>

<p>“But I’m sure they don’t want boys fussing round
them,” objected Mrs. Miller.</p>

<p>“Yes, they do, mother,” quickly corrected Ned.
“Lots of boys march.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that they’ll gladly take anybody large
enough to carry a torch,” confessed Mr. Miller.</p>

<p>“The idea!” exclaimed his wife, shocked by this
give-away of political methods.</p>

<p>As time wore on, the approaching rally grew to
mammoth proportions, and kept Ned busy talking
about its numerous phases.</p>

<p><cite>The Clarion</cite> devoted columns of space to it, and
the town was well plastered with posters bristling
with exclamation points and heavy type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>As to his marching, Ned now had not the slightest
doubt. His father said nothing more upon the subject,
and silence gave consent.</p>

<p>“My father says <em>we</em>’re going to have a monster
rally, too; the night before election,” at last Hal declared,
in retort to Ned’s vauntings.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t be as big as ours,” asserted Ned.</p>

<p>“’Twill, I bet,” stoutly returned Hal, sticking up
for the honor of the Democratic party. “And I’m
going to march!”</p>

<p>“Are you?” queried Ned, feeling as though some
of the polish had been taken off his own future.</p>

<p>Of course, there was the remote chance that rain
would interfere with the Republicans, or that in some
other way the Democrats would be led to outdo
them.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;no, I didn’t mean that; but I tell you
what,” he proposed, suddenly: “you march with
me in our parade, and I’ll march with you in yours!”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Hal. “You don’t suppose
they’ll care, do you?”</p>

<p>By “they” he referred to Republicans and Democrats
in general, who might be disposed to resent
such an exchange.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” hazarded Ned. “It evens up, you
know. And then, we’re only kids.”</p>

<p>The day of the parade came, and dawned upon a
town already gay with bunting and banners. As
the sun rose higher, and peeped into the streets,
seemingly at the touch of his rays other bunting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
banners unfolded. By noon Republican Beaufort was
in gala attire. Democratic Beaufort stolidly gazed,
and resolved:</p>

<p>“Just wait until our turn, next week.”</p>

<p>Lithographs of the Republican candidates were
displayed on all sides, in windows and attached to
flags drooping from upper stories; cheese-cloth,
bearing mottoes and portraits, spanned the downtown
streets and stretched across corners; through
the ordinary channels of business and private
affairs ran a current of excitement.</p>

<p>“So you’re going to march, are you, Ned?” remarked
his father, that noon, at dinner.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Neddie,” begged his mother. “You’ll
get all covered with dirt and grease; and I’m sure
the sight of you in the ranks won’t influence <em>many</em>
voters.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve promised Hal to march in his parade
if he’ll march in mine,” explained Ned. “And
he’ll be mad if I back out. I’ll wear my old
clothes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller sighed and looked, for support, at her
husband. However, not having Ned’s garments to
clean, he was filled only with amusement.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on, the delegations from
outside points began to arrive. In the shape of
marching clubs, with wild cheers they tumbled off
from incoming trains, and forming at the depot
paraded up town, bands playing and people shouting.
Or as farmers’ families they rattled in by wagon-loads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and tying the horses around the court-house
square wandered through the streets.</p>

<p>In the schoolroom Ned and his fellow prisoners
could hear the cries and music and sound of heavy
wheels, and chafed to be free. With the welcome
four o’clock bell they poured abroad, quite certain
that there were a thousand new things to see.</p>

<p>This afternoon Bob sat at the front gate and waited
in vain. He was cut out by politics.</p>

<p>His master, who had found much to do in watching
the depots, and not missing what the streets also
had to offer, did not appear until nearly supper time.</p>

<p>“Here you are, Ned,” called Mr. Miller, <cite>Clarion</cite> in
hand. “This means you: ‘Marchers not attached to
any organization may obtain their uniforms at Room
6, Shinn Block. It is requested that the uniforms be
returned here, either immediately after the meeting,
or to-morrow.’”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Ned. “What kind of uniform?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing very extra, you’ll find,” replied his
father, destroying Ned’s visions of epaulets and a
cocked hat.</p>

<p>“But it will serve to keep your clothes from the
oil and soot, I hope,” voiced the thrifty mother.</p>

<p>Ned galloped through his chores, and bolted a
hasty supper. Hal whistled for him, and ruthlessly
shutting in the barn the luckless Bob&mdash;who would
have been unhappy, anyway, with so many bands
playing in his ears, and so many feet to dodge&mdash;he
scooted off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll watch for you, when the parade comes past
the corner,” cried his mother, after him; for the line
of march led within a block of the house.</p>

<p>Already streams of people, mostly men and boys,
some even now in uniform, were flowing toward the
business centre of town; and that business centre
itself was a fascinating scene of bustle, as the marchers,
in a variety of costumes, strode the walks, or
loitered at their points of assembly.</p>

<p>For Ned and Hal, the first thing to do was to get
uniforms. Until they had some trappings they could
not feel as though they amounted to much.</p>

<p>Room 6, Shinn Block, fairly was swarming with
persons after uniforms. In one corner was a pile of
capes, near by was a stack of caps, and in another
corner were sheaves of torches. Evidently all that
was necessary to do was to walk up, pick out an outfit,
and leave.</p>

<p>The two boys sidled in, and had just seized upon a
cape apiece when they were interrupted by a man
who from beside the door was overseeing things.</p>

<p>“Hey, you kids! What are you doing with those
capes?” he demanded, gruffly.</p>

<p>Ned and Hal, startled and abashed, dropped their
spoils.</p>

<p>“We’re going to march,” stammered Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. It’s Will Miller’s boy,” explained
somebody in the room, coming to the rescue.
“Let him march.”</p>

<p>“And isn’t that young Lucas?” queried somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
else. “Is your father going to march with us
to-night, too, sonny?”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t!” retorted Hal, hotly. “He’s going
to be in a lots bigger parade than this, next week!”</p>

<p>Amid the teasing laughter which greeted this sally
the boys snatched cape and cap and torch, and fled
lest yet they might be stopped.</p>

<p>The capes were of blue oilcloth, and buckled at the
throat. The caps also were of oilcloth, but red, and
were round, with a flat top and heavy visor. The
torches consisted of a long staff, at the end of which
swung a can containing kerosene and a wick.</p>

<p>As soon as they were clear of the room the boys
donned their rigs. The capes came down to their
knees; and since in their haste they had not taken
account of size, their caps were far too large, and
spun about on their crowns. Paper, a tremendous
quantity, having been stuffed under the bands inside,
then, with their caps still wobbly, but with their
capes rustling and their torches proudly held aloft,
the two brave marchers descended to the street.</p>

<p>Even during their brief stay while getting their
outfit, a change had taken place in the aspect of the
world without. Darkness had fallen, and torches
were being called into life, right and left.</p>

<p>“Let’s light up!” proposed Hal.</p>

<p>“Let’s,” seconded Ned.</p>

<p>This was as easily done as said; they simply applied
their wicks to the lighted wick of the next good-natured
man whom they met&mdash;and good nature was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
everywhere to-night&mdash;and now, with torches blazing,
they were fully in trim for the parade.</p>

<p>The procession was forming. On horseback marshals,
distinguished by a sash passing from one
shoulder diagonally across the chest and under the
opposite arm, dashed up, and wheeled and dashed
down again. Horns gave preliminary, erratic toots,
and drums broke in with sudden rolls. Flambeaux
flamed forth, and died out. Transparencies bobbed
hither and thither, upon invisible legs. Marching
clubs stood at ease, while their members jested and
waited. The air was filled with kerosene smoke and
echoing voices.</p>

<p>Ned and Hal, holding their heads stiffly lest their
caps should tumble off, and wrapped in their blue
capes like a cattle-man in his poncho, sped to the
corner mentioned by <cite>The Clarion</cite> as the meeting
place of the “unattached.” Here had gathered
about fifty other blue capes and red caps, and the
number was slowly being swelled.</p>

<p>“Hi there!” hailed a marshal, spurring to them.
“You men close in, in column of fours, on the rear
of the procession, as it passes by.”</p>

<p>Off he tore again, while Ned and Hal felt not a
little elated at having been classed among the “men.”</p>

<p>The parade started. Drums commenced to beat
time, bands commenced to play, and forth into the
surrounding darkness flowed a little stream of lights
as if the sea of torches had sprung a-leak, and was
trickling down the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Hal and Ned had a good view of the make-up of
the procession; but they were impatient to become,
themselves, a part of it, and fretted at the delay.</p>

<p>“There comes the last!” exclaimed a self-appointed
leader. “Get ready, four abreast!”</p>

<p>In the confusion caused by forming some semblance
of ranks, the two boys found themselves
elbowed aside by tall men who didn’t want to be
made to look ridiculous, and by short men who
didn’t wish to be classed with “kids,” and by medium
sized men who evidently never had been boys&mdash;and
finally, when the whole had been divided by four,
Ned and Hal found themselves sifted back to the
rear, as remainders!</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to notice them or their plight.
For a moment they were dismayed.</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t let’s care,” said Ned, bluffly. “We
can march, just the same.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” responded Hal. “And it’s more fun
to be two,” he added, defiantly.</p>

<p>The column moved jerkily past, “hitching” along,
after the manner of all processions in starting, as
though it was learning to walk. When the tail came
opposite, the blue capes joined themselves to it, and
now the parade moved off, complete&mdash;a whip lash
of bobbing lights, with the blue capes forming the
snapper, and Ned and Hal being the frayed tip.</p>

<p>Bands played conflicting tunes; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flambeaux</span> flared
and red fire glared; transparencies curtsied and
turned themselves about for approval; the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
lined up along the curb upon either side of the route
hooted and cheered.</p>

<p>Away at the end Ned and Hal proudly held their
torches as high as they could, and tried to keep step
with the men in front of them. Theirs was the most
uncomfortable station in the line. All the dust, and
the soot and reek from the kerosene drifted back to
enfold them; the red fire was burned out before they
arrived, and likewise the spectators had done their
cheering and were taking short cuts to other points.
Worse than all this, as the rear of the procession filed
by the onlookers crowded in behind it, and fairly
stepped on the heels of the two boys.</p>

<p>The parade was now about to traverse a section of
South Beaufort&mdash;and Ned and Hal, realizing that
they were nearing the enemy’s country, grew a little
nervous. It was at no little risk that a boy from
Beaufort proper crossed the dead-line into South
Beaufort&mdash;the lurking place of the Conners, and
“Slim” and “Fat” Sullivan, and Luke McCoy, and
“Big” Mike Farr and “Loppy” Lynch, and the rest
of the “gang”!</p>

<p>However, it was too late to back out. The rear
guard must hold its post.</p>

<p>Hardly had the tail of the procession passed over
the South Beaufort threshold, when rose the jeering
cry:</p>

<p>“The kids! Say, catch on to the kids hangin’ on
behind!”</p>

<p>A lump of dirt slapped against Ned’s oilcloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
cape. Another knocked Hal’s cap askew. Small
lads and girls pressed close upon them and threatened
and mocked, while big brothers and sisters in the
background encouraged.</p>

<p>The two boys pretended not to notice, but looked
straight ahead while earnestly wishing that they were
again in their own district.</p>

<p>But the worst was coming.</p>

<p>The nagging urchins, urged on from all sides,
waxed bolder, and began to jerk at the boys’ capes,
so that both were being compelled to struggle along
like engines towing a line of cars.</p>

<p>This was getting to be too much.</p>

<p>“Oh, let go, will you!” growled Ned, crossly, turning
and giving his foremost tormentor a sharp push.</p>

<p>“Hi, Mike, he hit your brother!” delightedly rose
a chorus of voices.</p>

<p>“Sock it to him, Patsy! Don’t you stand it!” advised
others.</p>

<p>“Aw, Patsy! To let a feller like him hit yer!”
jeered still others.</p>

<p>Thus egged on, Patsy, who was not even up to
Ned’s shoulders, doubled his scrawny, dirty fists, and
scowled fiercely.</p>

<p>“What did you hit me fer? I wasn’t doin’ nothin’,”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hit you. You were too!” replied
Ned, seeking to go on. But too late. He was
hemmed about, as through magic, by a circle which cut
him off from Hal and from the procession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The parade with the blue cape snapper went its
way, unaware that it had lost its frayed tip, for Hal,
too, was having his troubles.</p>

<p>“G’wan!” sneered Ned’s mite of a foe, hunching
himself forward, brave in his knowledge that the majority
was with him.</p>

<p>“Soak it to him, Patsy,” howled the ring of spectators.</p>

<p>They took up the playful practice of shoving one
another against Ned, who, like a baited bear, was assailed
from all sides.</p>

<p>“G’wan!” piped Patsy, again, trampling on Ned’s
toes.</p>

<p>Somebody smartly knocked Ned’s cap off. Somebody
reached over and wrenched at his torch, and
while he was striving to keep it his cape was neatly
turned over his head just as Patsy struck him a stinging
blow on the mouth.</p>

<p>Blinded in his cape, poor Ned floundered here and
there, jostled, kicked, and beaten, until he thought
that his last hour had come. He lost his cap, and
he lost his torch, and finally the fastenings of his
cape gave way and he lost it, too. This proved
lucky, for with a plunge he broke the ring hemming
him in, and in the mix-up escaped.</p>

<p>He was discovered.</p>

<p>“Here he is!”</p>

<p>“Stop him!”</p>

<p>“Head him off!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kill him!”</p>

<p>Ned, never doubting that they would “kill him” if
they caught him, darted down the street, and into an
alley, his laughing, whooping pursuers full tilt after
him. Over fences, through yards, breathless, desperate,
hunted, dodged Ned, and the hue and cry died
in the distance. He ventured out upon a street, and
slackened to a walk.</p>

<p>Bareheaded, bruised and aching, his trappings in
the hands of the enemy, he cared no more for the
parade. He went straight home.</p>

<p>As he neared the gate, he saw a figure sitting on
the horse-block before it.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Hal?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hal. “Did they hurt you?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not much,” asserted Ned, going to the
horse-block. “Did they jump on you, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hal, with a little sob in his voice.
“They grabbed me from behind, and held me, and
then somebody hit me, and then they all piled on
me&mdash;the dirty cowards.”</p>

<p>“So they did on me,” announced Ned, knowing
that misery loves company.</p>

<p>“They don’t fight fair!” sobbed Hal. “And they
took my cap and cape and torch.”</p>

<p>“Mine, too,” said Ned. “But I’ll get my father to
explain so the men won’t think we stole them. And
we’ll get even with that South Beaufort gang, some
day.”</p>

<p>“You bet we will,” vowed Hal, pulling himself together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
“They didn’t hurt me much, only they
didn’t give me any chance.”</p>

<p>The boys compared notes, and found that neither
was damaged beyond a few bruises, and their
wounded spirits. They spent an hour going over
plans to get even; the best seemed to be to enlist
all their friends for the Democratic parade, and
march through South Beaufort, and when the moment
came, to turn on the “gang” and simply
annihilate it.</p>

<p>However, this plan did not ripen, mainly because
the Democratic parade was prevented by rain.</p>

<span class = "small">THE TROUBLE AT BREEDE’S HILL</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">“Ned</span>&mdash;oh, Ned! It’s snowing!” called
Mr. Miller, up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Bully!” called back Ned, bouncing
out of that bed which only a moment before he had
been loth to leave.</p>

<p>He jumped to the window, and gazed out. The
big flakes swirled against the pane at the end of his
nose. Air and earth were white.</p>

<p>“Bully!” again exclaimed Ned, hustling on his
clothes.</p>

<p>The affair of the campaign parade was now only
an irritating memory; a president and vice-president
had been elected; processions were a thing of the
past, with the Republican county central committee
short two torches, two caps, and two capes; winter
had arrived with a swoop, sending the wild fowl
scurrying for the gulf; Thanksgiving&mdash;a snapping
cold Thanksgiving of skating and appetites&mdash;was
over; and still upon the frozen ground no snow had
fallen.</p>

<p>But here it was, at last, with a vengeance.</p>

<p>“Walks to clean, Neddie,” teased his mother.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” retorted Ned, from his room.</p>

<p>“There! Don’t forget that you’ve said it,”
laughed his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Now at the beginning of the winter it seemed to
Ned that he would as soon as not shovel walks.
Anything that had to do with snow was fun.</p>

<p>All day the snow fell. At first it was in the shape
of big, feathery flakes which clung to everything
that they touched. Then, when a good thick coating
had been given the world, down came the gritty,
small flakes, sifting upon their larger predecessors,
and piling up for two feet.</p>

<p>Thus, at the bottom was the layer of damp “packing”
snow, and at the top was the colder, freezing
layer. Conditions for coasting could not have been
better had the Beaufort young people planned and
carried out to suit themselves.</p>

<p>Moreover, to-day was Thursday. By Saturday
Breede’s Hill would be in prime condition.</p>

<p>With the approach of night the downfall slackened.
Through all the town sounded the scrape,
scrape of the snow-shovel. Ned added his note to
the harmony, for he had a front walk, and a walk
around the house, and a path to the barn, and one
to the wood-shed to clean, besides a few trimmings
such as the horse-block, and the steps and porches.</p>

<p>Bob welcomed the snow with great zest. He
frolicked and barked, and scooped up mouthfuls in
defiance of the theory that eating snow gives one the
sore throat. No doubt he barked so much that his
throat did not have time to get sore.</p>

<p>Dogs have their own rules of hygiene, anyway.</p>

<p>Ned’s sled had been brought out from summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
quarters in the attic, and had been waiting on the
back porch for quite a month. Although, on account
of his extra chores, he could not use it at
once, during his labors between school and supper
he could not resist giving it a moment of exercise&mdash;just
to limber it up. It left a red trail of rust; but
he knew that the rust would soon wear off.</p>

<p>This sled of Ned’s was a novelty, and the joy of
his heart. It was of clipper pattern, but very low&mdash;not
more than four inches from the ground. It had
sharp points, longer than its body; when Ned
flopped upon it the points stuck far out before, and
his legs stuck far out behind. The runners were
round steel, and well sprung. How that sled did go!
It was no good for ruts, or for deep snow, but given
a smooth track it could beat any sled in Beaufort.
No matter how icy the hill, when other sleds had a
tendency to veer and drift sideways this little sled
darted straight as an arrow beyond the mark of all.</p>

<p>Sighing because now was night instead of morning
Ned restored the sled, with a fond pat of promise, to
its corner, and went in to supper, whither he had
been drawn for some time by the delicious sizzling
of fried mush.</p>

<p>Friday broke bright as a new dollar, with sunshine
that proved just warm enough to soften the snow and
settle it. Around school passed the word among
Ned and Hal and Tom and kindred spirits to “come
to Breede’s Hill and help break it.”</p>

<p>Breede’s Hill&mdash;ah, but that was a hill for you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Two blocks of slope and two blocks more of slide,
and all, in the height of the season, as smooth as
oil! Here were four blocks of street practically
given over to the coasters. For a driver to try the
slippery incline, either on wheels or on runners, was
foolhardy; while to cross at the base was to invite a
sudden attack from catapult bob or sled.</p>

<p>A bob had been known to scoot right between the
wheels of a wagon, and not hurt a thing, so swift
was it going; and Ned himself, horrified, unable to
stop, had taken the legs from under a stupid cow;
but when she had reached the snow with a thump he
had been far away.</p>

<p>Breede’s Hill had been so dubbed by some history
enthusiast; on the next street south was Bunker
Hill, in like manner named. It was not a proper
hill for coasting, being rocky, and having a sharp
curve.</p>

<p>On this Friday afternoon after school Ned, accompanied
by Bob, gaily dragged his snake-like sled
to Breede’s Hill. Here he and a dozen others toiled
lustily for an hour and a half, breaking a track. One
or two sleighs had been along the road, but the
snow lay deep and white, with its possibilities still
undeveloped.</p>

<p>It was necessary to tramp the snow down, and
drag sleds through it, sideways, and even to roll in
it, in order to clear a path which, under the friction
of the runners, should become hard and “slick.”</p>

<p>To the tramping and scraping, and frolicsome rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Bob lent nothing but his noisy good-will and applause.
One would have thought, noting his hilarity,
that the snow and the boys had come together simply
for his entertainment!</p>

<p>Finally a track deemed worthy of being tested
had been leveled, and the first coast of the season
was made, with a whoop of joy, by the other bob in
the party&mdash;the bob-sled.</p>

<p>Farther and farther, each time, went the bob, with
the single sleds&mdash;all but that of Ned&mdash;in the party,
bringing up behind. Ned rode on the bob, until the
moment when the track should be hard and fit for
his low clipper.</p>

<p>This was the only drawback to that pride of his
heart: it was useless in loose snow, or in ruts.</p>

<p>At dark, by dint of much play which seemed like
work, Breede’s Hill was fit for the final polishing, by
a hundred and more runners, on the morrow. Ned
went home, and Bob went home, and the other boys
went home, hungry and well satisfied; and none was
more hungry or more satisfied than Bob, who had
done the least and fussed the most.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;but the hill is getting dandy!” exclaimed
Ned, at dinner, Saturday, to which he had come
panting and damp and perfectly empty.</p>

<p>“So you’re tired of that gun, already, are you,
Neddie?” remarked his mother, quietly.</p>

<p>“My, no!” denied Ned, in alarm. “But the hill’s
splendid, anyway. It’s almost slick as glass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“The whole town will be there, this afternoon,”
he added, poising a generous mouthful of apple
pie.</p>

<p>“I won’t be there,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said his father.</p>

<p>“Well, all the kids and girls will,” explained Ned;
and the chunk of pie disappeared, to fill some mysterious
crevice inside. “Shoveling in fuel,” his
father termed Ned’s eating during the cold weather;
but whether the statement was true or a joke, the
reader must judge according to his own experience.</p>

<p>That afternoon it really did seem that Ned had
not exaggerated. Breede’s Hill was in its glory, and
“the whole town” was on hand, with sleds of all
descriptions.</p>

<p>The track had been packed solid, and glistened in
the glancing rays of the sun. Downward sped, with
shrill shrieks from the girls and wild halloos of warning
from the boys, a torrent of figures showing black
against the white background; and upward toiled,
along either side of the torrent, a swarm of other
black figures, to halt, and gather, and turn at the
crest.</p>

<p>Bob was there, a privileged character. Not a dog
in Beaufort was so widely or favorably known.
What fun he found here at a place where he
was almost the only one whose legs had to take
him down hill as well as up, is a problem. Like
a flash Ned on his clipper shot from top to bottom&mdash;and
skirting the track, with tongue out and with
excited yelps, falling farther and farther behind, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
him raced Bob, not to catch him until the sled had
stopped. Up trudged Ned, hauling his sled, with
Bob at last by his heels; and the performance was
repeated.</p>

<p>At the hill all now was gaiety and glee. The only
thing to mar, ever so slightly, the sport, was the
presence of a party from South Beaufort. Eight
strong they had arrived, with their bob; and discoloring
the snow with tobacco, and swearing freely,
they had proceeded to impress the others with their
importance.</p>

<p>However, beyond elbowing their way about freely,
and profaning snow and air, and acting just as they
pleased, they had made no especial trouble, and Ned
and the other boys tried to pay no attention to them.</p>

<p>By this time two grooves had been worn in the
track, and along them rushed, with no steering
needed, the sleds great and small. The street
crossings were hair-raising bumps, which caused
each sled to leap like a frightened colt. Highest
of all bounced Ned on his light clipper, and farthest
of all he went, setting a mark which none could
touch. Still firm in his faith that some time he
would catch him was Bob, racing madly down, and
panting sedately up.</p>

<p>At last merely sliding down hill ceased to prove of
much interest to the South Beauforters. Trouble
was what they wanted; trouble they would have;
and the meaner the brand the better it would suit
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>They began to bully the smaller boys, and to
blockade, as though by accident, but really with sly
malice, the steps of the larger. They sent girls’
sleds careening down the slope, and in a hundred
ways made themselves a dread and an annoyance.</p>

<p>“Come on, Ned, let’s go home,” pleaded little
Tennie Loders, who lived near Ned, plucking him
by the sleeve. “I’m cold.”</p>

<p>“He’s afraid,” scoffed Sam Higgs. “That’s what’s
the matter with him.”</p>

<p>“You run along, Tennie,” said Ned. “But I’m
not going to leave till I get good and ready. Nobody’s
going to drive <em>me</em> off, you bet.”</p>

<p>“Who’s tryin’ to drive you off? Say, kid, who’s
tryin’ to drive you off?” sneered Big Mike Farr, who
overheard.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anybody was, did I?” returned Ned,
stoutly.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t go shootin’ off your lip ’round here,
then,” grumbled Big Mike, in an ugly tone. He
waited to see if Ned wouldn’t answer back and
give him a better chance to force a fight; but Ned
never spoke a word, and the South Beauforter slouched
back among his fellows, while they laughed loudly.</p>

<p>For a brief space the coasting continued without
especial incident. However, this was only a lull,
during which the South Beauforters were but biding
their chance. Presently it came.</p>

<p>As they artfully lingered around their bob-sled, at
the end of the track, they saw Ned, head on, sweeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
toward them upon his clipper. Just as he reached
them they neatly jerked their heavy bob square across
his path. There was no time for him to swerve.
With a thud he struck broadside the rearmost of the
two sleds. The clipper stopped short, as though
killed; but Ned himself went plunging on, clear
over the bob, to plough the snow and slush with
face and hands and stomach.</p>

<p>He scrambled up wet, furious, yet willing, if
allowed, to accept the mishap as a bit of rude
joking. He felt that discretion was here the
better part of valor.</p>

<p>However, he was not given any choice in the
matter.</p>

<p>“Say,” accosted Big Mike, again, as Ned walked
forward, while brushing himself off, to get his sled,
“what do you mean by runnin’ into us? Ain’t you
got eyes?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it,” said Ned. “I didn’t have
time to turn out.”</p>

<p>“You did, too,” snarled a Conner, giving Ned’s
innocent clipper a vicious kick into the ditch.</p>

<p>“I didn’t. You pulled your bob across the track
on purpose&mdash;you know you did,” accused Ned,
goaded beyond bearing.</p>

<p>The words were attracting a little knot of spectators
and listeners, and as Ned started to rescue his
beloved sled from the ditch Bob nosed into the circle,
seeking him. Whereupon a South Beauforter planted
his toe in Bob’s astonished ribs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ki yi! yi, yi, yi!” yelped Bob, and the sound
was to Ned a bugle call to action.</p>

<p>“Here&mdash;you’d better not do that again!” he
warned, returning with a spring.</p>

<p>“Do what again?” demanded Big Mike, threateningly.</p>

<p>“Hurt that dog. He’s never done anything to
you,” asserted Ned, his blood up in defense of his
faithful partner.</p>

<p>“Aw, who’s hurtin’ yer dog?” scoffed Big Mike&mdash;at
the same instant aiming another blow at Bob,
shivering close against his master’s legs.</p>

<p>Ned responded with a violent shove that nearly
took the South Beauforter off his feet.</p>

<p>“Hit him, Mike!”</p>

<p>“Smash him one in the jaw!”</p>

<p>“Aw, I wouldn’t stan’ that from nobody!”</p>

<p>“Paste it to him!”</p>

<p>“He’s the cully what struck Patsy!”</p>

<p>Amid this clamor from his backers Big Mike
doubled his fists and stuck his face close up to
Ned’s.</p>

<p>“Who you shovin’, anyway?” he snarled, treading
on Ned’s toes, at the same time shouldering him violently
backward.</p>

<p>“You!” answered Ned, boldly, recovering his balance.</p>

<p>“Don’t take any of his lip!”</p>

<p>“Punch him in the nose!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aw, Mike! ’Feared of a kid like that!”</p>

<p>Thus urged, and with his gang pressing closer and
closer about them, Big Mike swung his clenched
hands back and forth, menacingly, and growled:</p>

<p>“Tryin’ to pick a fight, ain’t ye? I’ve a notion to
lam the tar out o’ you!”</p>

<p>“You can’t do it, alone,” challenged Ned. “You
know your gang will pitch in and help, if you’re getting
licked.”</p>

<p>“Naw, we won’t. Of course we won’t,” cried the
South Beauforters, in a chorus. “It’ll be fair play;
sure it will!”</p>

<p>Ned knew that this was a lie. The South Beauforters
never fought fair. They were wolves, attacking
from both front and rear, and five to one. Besides,
they bit and kicked and gouged, and had no
mercy. Fair? Not much!</p>

<p>Ned gazed hastily around the circle, seeking some
one who might second him, and protect his back.
But of Hal or Tom or others of his chums he saw
not a sign. They must be at the top of the hill, or
climbing, and ignorant of his fix.</p>

<p>His heart sank a little.</p>

<p>However, he was not afraid of Big Mike, in a fair
fight. “Big Mike” had been thus nicknamed because
he had been overgrown; but now, stunted as
he was by tobacco and by evil habits, flat-footed and
with hulking shoulders, no longer was he large for
his age. Ned, on his own part, had been leaping
ahead by inches, until now he equaled Mike in
height, although considerably outweighed. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
whatever advantage came to the one from weight
was more than balanced by the other’s wiriness and
strength of limb gained on river and in wood and
field.</p>

<p>Ned was not given much time in which to look
about or debate over his situation. Shoved by a
member of the gang, after the fashion of the kind,
Big Mike came jamming into him, and swinging at
the same time cuffed him a blow on the ear. At this
Ned poked stiffly upward with his right fist, and his
knuckles met Big Mike’s teeth.</p>

<p>Big Mike backed away a step, and dabbled at his
mouth with his fingers.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;did you go to do that?” he roared.</p>

<p>“You hit me first,” replied Ned, angrily.</p>

<p>With a volley of oaths, and a kick and a blow delivered
together, Big Mike charged at him&mdash;a regular
wildcat.</p>

<p>A little murmur of “Oh’s” and “Ah’s” went up
from Ned’s sympathizers.</p>

<p>“Give it to him, Mike! Give it to him!” cheered
the South Beauforters, crazy with delight.</p>

<p>The blow took Ned on the top of the head; but the
kick fell short. Ned grabbed the leg and heaved up
on it, until Big Mike tottered and took a heavy fall.</p>

<p>He was on his feet in an instant, and with head
down butted for Ned’s stomach. Hindered by the
crafty gang Ned could do nothing but accept the attack,
and bump his opponent’s nose with his lifted
knee; and now Big Mike, head into his stomach, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
him tightly about the waist and was striving to bend
him backward. Ned doubled forward and while trying
to keep his balance reached under and punched
Big Mike’s face.</p>

<p>It was a deadlock, Big Mike straining, and Ned
poking, and neither much the worse off.</p>

<p>But the South Beauforters could not hold back any
longer. Weaving in and out so as always to be back
of Ned as the fighters shifted and struggled in a circle,
they aimed treacherous blows at him; and at this
crisis little Patsy, keen to aid his brother, darting in
seized Ned by the ankles and enabled Big Mike to
bring him to the ground.</p>

<p>“Shame! No fair!” cried indignant boys and girls.</p>

<p>Even at this juncture Ned was by no means defeated.
His blood was roused, and he felt that he
was battling for his life. Big Mike tried to sit astride
of him, but he might as well have tried to sit on an
eel. Ned wriggled and twisted, and out of the rough-and-tumble
behold the picture of Ned on the top;
with Big Mike’s hands clenched in his hair, it is true;
but nevertheless, Ned on top!</p>

<p>To off-set the hair-grip, his thumb was against the
side of Big Mike’s nose, pressing that individual’s
head sidewise until his cheek was in the slush.</p>

<p>It was not a picture of beauty. Big Mike’s lips
were bleeding, and Ned’s left eye was inflamed where
Big Mike had brutally stuck a thumb, to gouge.
The faces of both were red, and Ned’s necktie was
streaming over his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was the picture pleasing to Big Mike’s cronies.
Their champion was in the worse position of the two.
So the Conners, with a curt command: “Aw, get off
of him, will you!” jumped in and obligingly turned
the pair over.</p>

<p>This was the South Beaufort way of winning
fights.</p>

<p>In the meantime little Zu-zu Pearce, leaving the
other girls, who, with awe-stricken faces and throbbing
hearts, unable to tear themselves away, lingered
on the outskirts, ran with all her might for the hill.
Up the slope she labored, slipping and puffing, until
near the top she overtook her brother, and Hal and
a half dozen others, trudging with their bob for the
crest and a coast.</p>

<p>“Tom!” screamed Zu-zu, frantically. “Oh, Tom&mdash;the
South Beaufort fellows have got Ned Miller at
the bottom of the hill, and are beating him awful!
They won’t let him fight Big Mike fair.”</p>

<p>“Gee! Come on, fellows!” exclaimed Tom; and
in a jiffy the bob was jerked about, and with the boys
recklessly piling on was speeding down the track, for
the fight.</p>

<p>Close in their wake sped also a following of single
sleds&mdash;for the news had spread like lightning.</p>

<p>“Goody! Here they come!” cried the anxious
girls, dancing in joy. “Oh, hurry, hurry!”</p>

<p>Slim Conner heard, and glimpsed the reinforcements
dashing down the slope for the scene. He
heard the shouts, and his mind acted quickly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cheese it, lads! Here’s the hull crowd!” he
warned, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Come away, Mike!” warned Patsy, tugging at
his brother.</p>

<p>Mike wrenched himself loose from the grip of the
prostrate Ned, and with a final kick at his victim’s
head ducked through the circle; and off, up the
road, ran the South Beauforters, dragging their bob.</p>

<p>Hal and Tom and the rest of the rescuers arrived
too late, although they had ditched their bob, without
waiting for it to stop, and had rolled into the
midst of the ring.</p>

<p>A few of the boys chased the South Beauforters a
block or two, just as a threat; but Hal and Tom
stayed to attend to Ned.</p>

<p>“Shucks, he didn’t hurt me a bit,” vowed Ned,
scorning assistance as he scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>“You’re going to have a black eye, all right
enough, though,” assured Tom.</p>

<p>“Am I?” asked Ned, cautiously feeling of his injured
face.</p>

<p>“Well, just the same he was licking Big Mike, if
they hadn’t all pitched on to him!” declared Tennie
Loders, stanchly.</p>

<p>“Look at my knuckles, where I hit him in the
mouth, will you!” said Ned, proudly.</p>

<p>“Here’s your necktie, Ned,” proffered Harriett
Taylor, holding it out to the hero of the hour.</p>

<p>Ned tied it on in a crooked knot, while the crowd
watched him admiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where were you fellows? Who told you about
it?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Why, we were going ahead coasting,” explained
Hal. “Zu-zu was the one who told us, and then we
came lickity-split.”</p>

<p>“Bully for Zu-zu!” exclaimed Ned. “She’s a
dandy!”</p>

<p>“I had to run all the way up hill,” said Zu-zu,
modestly, just arriving.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll remember you, all right, for it,” promised
Ned. “I’ll give you ducks’ wings till you can’t
rest.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t do it for that!” cried Zu-zu, skipping
off.</p>

<p>“Do you want to go home, Ned?” inquired Hal,
tenderly.</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” declared Ned. “I’m going
to slide some more. It’ll take more than a black
eye to get me off this hill!”</p>

<p>And during this recent fracas, what of Bob&mdash;Bob,
who brought on the fray? The rule of romance demands
that he should have launched himself to Ned’s
aid, and put the enemy to flight with his teeth. But
no; this history must take a different course. Twice
kicked by heavy boots, to which he had done no
wrong; trampled upon by many feet, and thrust
aside by many legs, quite regardless of the plight into
which he had forced his master, he had turned tail
and had trotted for home.</p>

<p>In his own mind, he had been sorely abused; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
with the spirits taken out of him by the ill-treatment,
he made straight for shelter.</p>

<p>When his master appeared, with eye now surrounded
by a blue-black mat, Bob, never considering
it, seemed to think that himself, and not Ned, had
been the sufferer.</p>

<span class = "small">THE ROUTING OF BIG MIKE</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Although</span> Bob was, as it seemed, so callous
to Ned’s black eye, not so with the other
members of the household.</p>

<p>Filled with recipes from his friends, for changing a
black eye to normal white, Ned returned home, and
unseen save by Bob, gained his room. He put in an
anxious half hour experimenting; but at the end his
eye seemed blacker than ever&mdash;a dense, deep, wicked
black. It seemed to Ned that there was nothing to
his face but that black eye; and assuming a manner
of unconcern he descended the stairs and went about
his chores.</p>

<p>“N-Ned!” gasped his mother, meeting him in
the kitchen. Maggie, the girl, giggled. Ned dropped
his armful of wood into the wood-box with the usual
crash, and answered, mildly, keeping his head down
while he pretended to arrange some of the sticks.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Look up here.”</p>

<p>Ned obeyed, trying to present only his white side.</p>

<p>“Why, what in the world have you been doing?
Is that a bruise around your eye, or is it dirt?”</p>

<p>“Bruise, I guess,” responded Ned, shuffling his feet
uneasily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Fight. Fellow stuck his thumb in it.”</p>

<p>Ned wished that his mother would let him alone;
but she would not.</p>

<p>“The very idea! Whom did you have a fight
with?”</p>

<p>“Big Mike Farr&mdash;and I’d have licked him only
they all jumped onto me.”</p>

<p>“Come here and let me look at it,” bade his
mother, aghast.</p>

<p>Ned approached, sheepish in mien, yet determined
to stick up for himself in case she took him to task.</p>

<p>But she did not. She stood him by the sink, and
while she treated his wound with homely remedies,
applied by soft touch, she let him tell his battle-story.
And when his story and his treatment had
been finished together, and he had emerged with a
huge bandage encircling his crown like a turban, she
only sighed:</p>

<p>“Oh, Neddie! Why <em>will</em> boys fight!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, ma’am, an’ I for one am mighty glad that
he wor havin’ the best of that Mike Farr,” blurted
Maggie, who had been listening with approval.
“Sure, Mike Farr is nothin’ but a coward an’ a blow.
<em>I</em> know him; I know him well, bad cess to him.”</p>

<p>“He’s mean, <em>isn’t</em> he, Maggie?” appealed Ned.</p>

<p>“That he is. He’ll come to the gallows; he will.
An’ all that South Beaufort gang, too. Yes, I know
’em,” declared Maggie, wagging her head. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>“They’re
regular little divils.”</p>

<p>“Maggie!” exclaimed Mrs. Miller, somewhat
shocked.</p>

<p>“Well, they’d better not tackle us fellows again,”
asserted Ned, swaggering out for another armful of
wood.</p>

<p>Maggie gazed after him admiringly.</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ I bet he’s a fighter when he gets
started,” she mused. “Look at them legs an’ arms!
An’ Big Mike twice his size, too.”</p>

<p>“Maggie,” reproved Mrs. Miller, “I don’t want
you to encourage Ned in fighting. I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>And she withdrew in dignity to the sitting-room,
where, safe in privacy, she did not know whether to
laugh or be provoked. At any rate, she did not
relish the idea of her Neddie going about with a
chip on his shoulder, challenging boys “twice his
size,” according to Maggie.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller, coming home, from afar descried
Ned’s turban as it bobbed around in the back
yard.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he hailed. “That’s a new kind of cap,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” smiled Ned. “And I’ve got a new
eye, too. Want to see it?” and advancing toward
the front to meet his father he obligingly lifted the
bandage.</p>

<p>“Phew!” said Mr. Miller, gravely. “I think I
prefer the old eye. Was this a present?”</p>

<p>“I traded for it,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>His father put a hand on his shoulder, and together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
they entered the house. Here Ned, helped
out by his mother, again made his explanations.
At the close his father simply said:</p>

<p>“Well, Ned, I don’t see how you could have acted
any differently&mdash;but I don’t approve of fighting, any
more than does your mother. Fighting is not always
a fair test of your side of a question, you
know. It is better to avoid a fight by every honorable
means in your power. Sometimes it is more
cowardly to fight than to keep from fighting. But
if you can’t avoid it,” he added, quizzically; “if
there’s nothing left to do, to save honor, but fight,
then fight for all there is in you!”</p>

<p>“Will!” protested Mrs. Miller, horrified.</p>

<p>“But if I had to fight&mdash;just <em>had</em> to fight&mdash;you’d
want me to lick, wouldn’t you, mother?” appealed
Ned.</p>

<p>“I can’t bear to think of your fighting at all,
Neddie,” declared his mother, firmly.</p>

<p>Ned’s black eye went away rapidly&mdash;although not
so rapidly as it had come&mdash;and he was made to
wear the bandage only a short time. For this he
was thankful, since warm weather arrived, and with
it “good packing”&mdash;and what boy can throw
straight with but one eye.</p>

<p>At first the thaw improved the coasting, but in
the end it spoiled it. So long as the coasting lasted
the South Beaufort gang continued to use the hill,
but no more fights occurred.</p>

<p>The two crowds let each other alone, carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
ignoring each other’s presence, the only exception
being when Bob dropped his tail between his legs,
reminded of past insults, and raised the bristles on
his back, and when Ned and Big Mike exchanged
scowls of mutual defiance. In this by-play of looks
Ned came off rather the worse, his eye still showing
up, while Big Mike was apparently as good&mdash;or as
bad&mdash;as ever.</p>

<p>The careful truce, however, was merely the calm
before the storm. Big Mike and his companions
were biding their time.</p>

<p>Much to Ned’s disappointment, the thaw merged
into a Saturday of foggy drizzle, under which the
snow silently ran away in water, instead of as
silently, but more slowly, vanishing as vapor into
the air.</p>

<p>Bound to have what few coasts might yet be found
on the hill, Ned and Bob hastened there the moment
that they had finished their early morning chores&mdash;“their”
chores, for Bob, although of no real help in
a manual way, always faithfully “stood by.”</p>

<p>At the same time with Ned and Bob, arrived on
the hill Hal and Tom. Les’ Porter, Orrie Lukes, and
three or four other boys already were there, and
several more came within a few moments.</p>

<p>The coasting was miserable. The track was slush
down to bare road, and from top to bottom the sled-runners
tore through with a “squshy” sound.
Ned’s clipper loyally set out to carry him as far
and as swiftly as ever, but after a few trials he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
obliged to retire it to one side, and take a seat on
Hal’s bob.</p>

<p>So poor was the going, that when a party of South
Beauforters appeared at the crest, they looked on for
a minute, sneeringly, and then slouched away, bobs,
and all, in the direction whence they had come.</p>

<p>“Good riddance!” scoffed Ned.</p>

<p>“Good riddance!” congratulated the crowd generally,
following his example.</p>

<p>Bob flaunted his tail at the retreating backs.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. The coasters, now about
twenty&mdash;including girls and small boys&mdash;were, as it
happened, for the most part at the top, preparing to
plough down again along the soft course, when
“thud!” “slap!” “biff!” into their midst tore a
hail of snowballs, smashing on face and body and
sled.</p>

<p>“Ki!” yapped Bob, startled by a stinging missile.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” exclaimed Jeff Patting, clapping his
hand to his cheek.</p>

<p>Before the astounded coasters could look around,
hurtled upon them another volley, escorted by a
slogan of shrill, triumphant, vengeful yells.</p>

<p>South Beauforters!</p>

<p>That riddance had not been so “good,” after all.
Reinforced, the party was returning, and pouring
from the mouth of a convenient alley, down swept
the enemy, to profit by his sudden approach.</p>

<p>Big Mike was there, and the Conners were there,
and Patsy, as fierce as any of them, was there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
South Beaufort had been wily enough to use the hill
while the hill was usable; but at last, in this day of
slush, it was free to throw off its mask and declare
war.</p>

<p>The coasters scattered. The small boys, some of
them frightened or hurt into crying, ran for home;
the girls, with scornful looks, disdaining to hurry,
withdrew in fair order to a safe distance; and the
larger boys, diverging to different points of the compass
as they essayed to reply yet bring off their sleds
safely, sought here and there for refuge.</p>

<p>With taunting cries the South Beauforters attacked
them viciously, worrying their every step.</p>

<p>“Watch out! They’re throwing ‘soakers’!”
warned Ned, as, keeping together, he and Hal and
Tom, dragging their bob, answering snowball with
snowball and taunt with taunt, stubbornly gave
ground up the opposite alley.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned! You left your sled!” suddenly exclaimed
Hal, stopping short.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;&mdash;!” uttered Ned, taking a hasty step toward
the crest again.</p>

<p>But too late. The crest was in possession of the
South Beauforters, and at the moment they had discovered
the clipper, deserted and lying in the ditch!
Big Mike it was who hauled it forth, Big Mike it was
who gleefully waggled its rope, Big Mike it was who
whooped the loudest and the most maddening.</p>

<p>“Hey! You leave that sled alone!” yelled Ned,
shaking his fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“You come and get it!” retorted Big Mike.</p>

<p>“I would if you were alone,” asserted Ned.</p>

<p>“Aw, I’ll give you another black eye,” gibed
Mike, while Ned dodged one well-aimed shot, and
caught a second on the leg.</p>

<p>“Just you wait till we put up this bob,” threatened
Hal.</p>

<p>“Yes, ‘just wait,’” mocked Big Mike and his
gang.</p>

<p>The bob was put up in short order by chucking it
over the alley fence of Hal’s home; then back rushed
the boys, to re-engage the foe.</p>

<p>They resolved that Ned must have his sled, at all
hazard. It was awful, to think of it in the hands
of that Mike. True little sled, the best sled in town.</p>

<p>As for Bob the dog, for all the aid he was to them,
they might as well have chucked him, too, over the
fence and left him. He was no good when it came
to this fighting at long range, and with his tail tightly
reefed, and his ears down, and an expression of intense
discomfort, he clung close to Ned’s calves.</p>

<p>Bob was no coward, but what dog likes to have
things thrown at him; and Bob was under the delusion
that every ball was aimed at him alone. He
couldn’t understand.</p>

<p>So for the rest of this fight he must be content not
to understand, and to play but a minor part.</p>

<p>The South Beauforters, now having in mind no
more worlds to conquer, decided to return to their
haunts. Laughing and swearing, they started to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
tramp up the road; and freest of all in mouth and
actions was Big Mike, twitching behind him the unwilling
clipper sled.</p>

<p>From the alley the three boys delivered a round
of snowballs as a token that the combat was on once
more.</p>

<p>“Head ’em off! Cut through the yards!” cried
Ned; over fences and through the yards scurried the
boys, and came out at the front of the retreating
foe.</p>

<p>“Give ’em ‘soakers’!” urged Hal, squeezing a
snowball between his knees.</p>

<p>“Soakers,” as the name shows, are snowballs which
have been soaked and wrung out, so to speak. They
are heavy, and hard, and when they hit, hurt.</p>

<p>They are not lawful snowballs, but in a warfare of
this kind they prove very useful.</p>

<p>By this time other boys had put away their bobs
and sleds, also, and had hastened to wage battle. By
this time, moreover, comrades far and wide were
getting the news, and dropping chore and game
were rallying to the scene.</p>

<p>Through yards, around corners, they sped; in ambush
behind tree-box and fence they waited; into
the ranks of the South Beauforters rained the
missiles.</p>

<p>“Soakers” was the watchword&mdash;and with the
slush so handy there was no danger of ammunition
running out.</p>

<p>On a small scale it was like that memorable retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of the British from Concord to Lexington.
The South Beauforters were the British, and the
others were the minutemen.</p>

<p>Big Mike and his gang tried to reply to the constant
fire; one of their balls, thrown by Slim Conner,
took Tom square on the nose as he incautiously
poked his head above the fence. A yell of triumph
arose from Slim and Co.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” appealed Tom, ducking hastily, and
touching his finger-tips gingerly to the wound.</p>

<p>“Let’s see, Tom,” said Hal.</p>

<p>Tom uncovered his nose. The left side of it was
skinned!</p>

<p>“They’re putting rocks in their snowballs!” declared
Ned. “Isn’t that just dirty mean, though!”</p>

<p>Tom, while somewhat disfigured, was by no means
disabled, and now and then feeling of his nose, continued
the pursuit.</p>

<p>Peppered from every quarter, the South Beauforters
began to waver, and showed a tendency to hop,
skip and jump along, and to turn corners on the
double quick. Presently, as by common consent,
all broke into a run, and the retreat became a
flight.</p>

<p>The “soakers” were waxing altogether too deadly.</p>

<p>Up the middle of the street, elbows raised to protect
heads, bolted the South Beaufort gang, and after
them, into the open, scuttled their attackers, whooping
like Indians. Even Bob mustered courage to
wave his tail, and bark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>From the outset the three boys, and Ned in particular,
had selected Big Mike as their especial target.
Had “soakers” been bullets they would have landed
him long before; but the most they had done was
to make him curse them heartily when some telling
ball reached the mark. And still he had the
clipper in tow.</p>

<p>“Drop that sled, you thief!” Ned kept calling,
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Thief! Robber!” chimed in Ned’s companions.</p>

<p>Closer the attackers drew their lines. Matters
looked promising for a general fight. The boys’
blood was up, and Ned was bound to get that
sled. “Soakers” seemed not to do it, and there
was nothing left but fists.</p>

<p>At this crisis, just as the pursuers were closing in
on the pursued, and “soakers” at short range were
on the point of giving way, unless something unexpected
occurred, to fisticuffs&mdash;then the unexpected
<em>did</em> occur!</p>

<p>Out of a cross-street whirled an empty lumber
wagon, mounted on runners and whisked behind
two horses, from the South Beaufort mills. The
South Beauforters hailed it as sent by a special
providence.</p>

<p>At any rate, the rescue was planned exactly right,
and in nick of time.</p>

<p>Just as the bob turned into their path, they met it.
Without causing it to slacken its speed, and without
themselves slackening, into the high box they tumbled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Patsy, and the Conners, and Red Sullivan, and
all&mdash;all except Big Mike!</p>

<p>Gleefully looking behind, to place thumb on nose
and wiggle his fingers at Ned and crowd, he proved
his own undoing. He slipped, and sprawled&mdash;and
away without him was borne his gang, with the
driver, a South Beauforter, laying lash on steeds.</p>

<p>But Big Mike did not sprawl long. Like a cat
he sprang to his feet, and dropping the clipper
now sought only to save himself from his deserts.</p>

<p>Ned, who was fleeter than the others, was the
nearest to him. On clumped Big Mike, spurred by
fear, in the trail of the faithless bob. After him
struggled Ned, spurred by wrath and only a few
yards from his heels. Behind them strung out the
other pursuers.</p>

<p>Of the two, hare and hound, the latter, Ned, because
he had been scaling so many fences and making
so many circuits, was the more exhausted.
However, he grimly hung on, and at the last
Fortune rewarded him.</p>

<p>The first limits of South Beaufort had been
reached; Big Mike was on familiar ground. The
hare had been run to its hole. With a sudden
movement Big Mike changed his course at right
angles, and darted for a friendly alley.</p>

<p>Ned dug his heel into the slush, and drew back his
arm, at the same time. Awaiting opportunity, during
all the chase he had been carrying a pet <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>“soaker.”
It had grown harder and harder, and now opportunity
bade “Ready!” Just as Big Mike, presenting the
broadside of his face, entered the alley, Ned, without
halting, sped his snowball. The “soaker,” whizzing
like a grape-shot, burst with an icy “smack” on Big
Mike’s ear!</p>

<p>“Ow-w-w-w!” screeched Big Mike, the last bit of
spunk taken out of him by that sudden blow.</p>

<p>Ned, puffing, turned and rejoined his comrades, to
receive congratulations&mdash;and his clipper.</p>

<p>The next Monday it was rumored at school, on
good authority, that Big Mike had an ear on him
looking like an over-ripe pear. Ned, hearing, was
pleased. He felt that his black eye had been
avenged.</p>

<span class = "small">THE LONG SKATE</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Like</span> the ill wind that nevertheless blows some
good, the thaw, although spoiling the coasting,
opened the way for two weeks of the
finest skating that Beaufort had ever known. The
snow had become water, but the water now became
ice.</p>

<p>For in the north Winter heard how his sovereignty
was thus being intruded upon by an o’er-anxious
Spring, and in haste dispatched to the scene General
Bitter-Cold. With his force General Bitter-Cold arrived,
amid a flourish of trumpets, late one night.
So well did he work that by morning Beaufort and
the country round-about was Winter’s again.</p>

<p>He sealed each pond and stream with the seal of
empire, and then proceeded to fetter anew the mighty
river.</p>

<p>Beaufort had a system of weather flags; and when,
for some hours preceding General Bitter-Cold’s arrival,
the cold-wave signal was flown from the staff
upon the town hall cupola, it was received by Ned
and his cronies, save Bob, with much delight. Bob,
being rather thin-skinned, much preferred spring, no
matter how early it might come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>But with no snow left, and with the streets mud and
water, Ned decided that almost anything would be
welcome.</p>

<p>“The paper says that the temperature will fall
forty degrees by morning,” announced Mr. Miller, at
supper.</p>

<p>“Won’t that be fine, though!” asserted Ned.</p>

<p>“It won’t be very fine for the poor people, however,”
suggested Mrs. Miller.</p>

<p>Ned tried to look solemn, but the picture of the
skating quite blotted out that of the poor.</p>

<p>That night, as he sunk his cheek into his pillow,
about to go to sleep, he heard old Boreas sound a
fanfare down the flue; and he chuckled and blissfully
cuddled into a ball.</p>

<p>In the barn loft Bob, at the end of his burrow amid
the hay, raised his head for a moment, inquiringly;
then, with a shiver instead of a chuckle, he, also, cuddled
closer.</p>

<p>The next morning Ned was detailed to sprinkle
ashes and sawdust upon the various walks and paths
belonging to the premises, so that the other members
of the household might venture out with safety. For
himself he left a narrow strip, leading from back stoop
to barn, unsprinkled; it was his private slide, and was
a constant peril to other back-yard visitors, notably
Maggie and Bob.</p>

<p>There was now excellent skating on the flats, where
several large ponds had been formed and had readily
frozen over. But the river yielded more slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
However, the zero weather was genuine, and had
come to stay a while. Grimly General Bitter-Cold
did his work, day by day and night by night building
from either bank out toward midstream, until finally
a juncture had been made and over the channel itself
had been spread a crust of crystal.</p>

<p>So quickly this crust deepened and toughened,
that soon an ice bridge had been staked out, and
teams were crossing from shore to shore.</p>

<p>The work of freezing had been done very quietly.
On this account the Mississippi was now like glass.
All Beaufort went skating. The field was unlimited,
save as in the swiftest parts of the current the water
continued to show, sullen and black.</p>

<p>“We’re going to skate down to Newton next
Saturday,” declared Ned, confidently.</p>

<p>“It’s good of you to tell us,” remarked his father,
mildly.</p>

<p>Ned was puzzled. He was not exactly sure what
the tone of voice meant.</p>

<p>“Well, can’t I?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“That is a problem,” replied his father, bent upon
teasing. “But I should think that a boy who not
an hour ago declared himself unequal to the task of
filling up two coal stoves might find considerable difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” pouted Ned, the hit telling. “I
mean, <em>may</em> I?”</p>

<p>“Just as your mother says,” answered his father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>“We’ll leave it to her.”</p>

<p>Ned’s face did not express any great joy over this
condition upon his going. He knew so well what an
amount of convincing his mother, always timid, winter
or summer, about the river, would take. Nevertheless,
he went boldly at his task.</p>

<p>“May I, mother?” he appealed to Mrs. Miller,
who had been listening with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Neddie! I don’t believe the ice is safe!” she
said.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” scoffed Ned. “It’s more than two feet
thick, right in the channel. You just ought to see
the big chunks they’re cutting out for next summer.”</p>

<p>“But Newton’s so far,” objected his mother. “You
wouldn’t get back until long after dark.”</p>

<p>“Why, mother!” exclaimed Ned, quite out of patience.
“It’s only fourteen miles and we can skate
that in an hour and a half easy.”</p>

<p>“I’m so afraid you’ll run into an air-hole, or something,
Neddie,” pleaded his mother, unwilling to pull
down her flag.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a bit of danger,” assured Ned, eagerly.
“Lots of the fellows have been down and back, and
there’s a regular path.”</p>

<p>“Who, for instance?” suddenly chipped in his
father. “‘Lots of fellows,’ I find, is sometimes
rather indefinite.”</p>

<p>“Lou Ravens and ‘Duke’ Burke did it just the
other afternoon,” promptly responded Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Still, since they are not centipedes it takes more
than two boys to make a path, you know, Ned,” said
his father, drily.</p>

<p>“But we could follow their skate marks&mdash;really we
could, father,” cried Ned. “May I go, mother?”</p>

<p>“What do <em>you</em> say, Will?” asked Mrs. Miller, seeking
refuge in her husband.</p>

<p>“Now that isn’t fair,” cried Ned. “Father said
he’d leave it to you. May I? It’s just as safe as our
back yard.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be very, very careful, and watch out for
air-holes?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” promised Ned.</p>

<p>“And be home before dark?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And not take any risks?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller looked doubtfully at her husband.
Ned foresaw surrender, and with a hug and a kiss he
won her over.</p>

<p>“Then I may! May I? I may&mdash;may I? Mother,
you’re just as good as you can be! And if you’ll
give me a quarter I can get some oyster soup at
Newton. Hal and Tom will. You see, we ought to
have something warm, and oyster soup is dandy
when a fellow’s empty.”</p>

<p>“Ask your father,” bade his mother, roguishly.
“I’ve furnished the permission, and he’ll have to
furnish the quarter.”</p>

<p>And it seemed to Ned that his mother had come
out rather ahead, in the bargain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not such a tremendously long skate upon
which the boys started Saturday morning. In a
straight line it would be only twelve miles, but by
the bending river, and by the extra strokes that they
would make in picking out the best patches of ice,
it would be nearer fifteen. So down and back, it
must be figured as thirty miles&mdash;only, the “back”
was to seem twenty times longer than the “down”!</p>

<p>Hal called for Ned, and together they made for
the levee, where they were to meet Tom. Ned
thought that he had done the feat of slipping off
without Bob’s seeing him. Bob was a very able dog,
<em>in</em> the water; but <em>on</em> the water he was of very little
use whatsoever. If in a boat, he became seasick;
and if on ice, he slipped and slid.</p>

<p>When the boys arrived at the levee they found
there not only Tom but also Zu-zu and a girl friend
of hers.</p>

<p>“Why, <em>you</em> aren’t going, are you, Zu-zu?” asked
Ned, in surprise.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;but I would if mamma’d let me,” replied
Zu-zu, tossing her head. “I could skate that far as
easy as not.”</p>

<p>“I bet you couldn’t,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“I could, too,” insisted Zu-zu. “You needn’t think
that just because we’re girls we can’t do anything.”</p>

<p>“What made you bring Bob?” queried Tom.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” said Ned.</p>

<p>Yet, at the moment Bob came sidling up from behind;
grinning, begging pardon, hopeful that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
would be forgiven and taken. It was very, very
rarely that he stole such a march upon his master,
for when he wasn’t wanted he usually had strength
of mind enough to stay away. But to-day had entered
into his head the idea that, willy-nilly, he
would make one of the party; and keeping out of
sight he had slyly sneaked along upon the opposite
side of the street from the two boys, until farther
dodging had been impossible.</p>

<p>“Bob! What are you doing here?” scolded Ned.
“Aren’t you ’shamed of yourself!”</p>

<p>Bob was. He hugged the snow, and with his
nervous tail confessed his hopes and fears.</p>

<p>“Go home!” thundered Ned.</p>

<p>Bob flattened himself still more, willing to be
whipped, but unwilling to go home.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned, don’t hurt him,” begged Zu-zu.
“We’ll take him back, won’t we, Bess? Poor
Bobbie!”</p>

<p>“All right,” responded Ned. “Only, he’s a bad
dog, just the same. He knew he’d no business to
come.”</p>

<p>Zu-zu gave Bob a friendly little pat.</p>

<p>“You’d like to go, the same as us, wouldn’t you,
Bob?” she said. “And we <em>would</em> go, too, if we
were only boys.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t be a boy,” asserted Bessie.</p>

<p>“I would,” averred Zu-zu.</p>

<p>Bob said nothing upon the subject. As a rule, he
was quite satisfied with being a dog. Zu-zu’s touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and voice, and the fact that the threshing did not descend,
filled him with sudden energy. Up he sprang,
thinking the crisis over; bounding and barking he
rejoiced mightily, and bade his master rejoice with
him. But on the contrary Ned paid him not the
slightest attention. Bob was a dog in disgrace.</p>

<p>Off the six went, the girls proudly keeping abreast
just to show what they could do, and Bob clawing
behind, trying to prove that he was as good as any
one on the ice, but nevertheless making poor work
of it when it came to turning corners.</p>

<p>They passed the Diamond Jo warehouse, and
Commodore Jones’ “boats-to-hire” establishment,
where wintered under cover the scull-boat; and still
skirting the shore sped under the bridge, between
the first pier and the high stone base.</p>

<p>Here the girls must stop.</p>

<p>Here Bob must stop.</p>

<p>“Mother said this was as far as you could go,
Zu-zu,” reminded Tom.</p>

<p>“Bob, go home!” ordered Ned.</p>

<p>“Come on, Bob,” cried Zu-zu.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said the boys, gliding on.</p>

<p>Bob was astounded, disappointed, hurt. He had
not been taken. All his apologies had been for
nothing. He was to be left with the girls!</p>

<p>He stood stock still, as if stunned, watching
the receding figures of the three boys. Then he
lifted his nose, and voiced his feelings in a piercing
howl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-bye,” again called Ned, turning and waving
his hand.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Ned,” called Zu-zu, waving back at
him.</p>

<p>“Wow-ow-ow-ow-u-u-u-u!” lamented Bob.</p>

<p>“When a dog howls it means somebody’s going
to die,” croaked Hal.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s none of us, anyway,” spoke
Ned, quickly.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” argued Hal. “Maybe
we’ll skate into a hole.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pish!” said Tom. “Shut up.”</p>

<p>“Wow-ow-ow-ow-u-u-u-u!” still mourned Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; it’s a shame, Bob,” said Zu-zu,
patting him. “We could go just as well as they,
couldn’t we? Only they’re boys, and we aren’t.”</p>

<p>Bob never gave her a glance. He turned his back
on her, and looking neither to one side nor the other,
with his tail curved downward and inward he climbed
the bank, and headed for home.</p>

<p>“He’s disgusted. Come on, Bess,” laughed Zu-zu.
So they skated up to the levee again.</p>

<p>The morning was glorious, with the sunbeams
glistening over the ice, and the air full of little
crystals. The river stretched broad and flat; here
and there a hummock, and here and there a change
from dark to light or from light to dark.</p>

<p>The steady rasp of the saws in the ice fields
mingled with the angry shriek of the circular steam
saws in the lumber-mills. All sounds were carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
far, through this crisp atmosphere, over the level
plain where once had been rippling water.</p>

<p>The boys felt like Mercuries, with winged heels,
so swiftly their skate-blades bore them onward. Before
they had uttered another word they were at the
head of Eagle Island. Here they had the choice of
taking Paper-mill Slough, or continuing upon the
river proper.</p>

<p>“Let’s go outside the island,” suggested Ned.
“They say the water that comes from the paper-mill
is so warm it eats away the ice, and that the slough’s
chuck-full of air-holes.”</p>

<p>Ned’s picture was enough to remove any question
as to routes, and down along the outside of the
island they dashed, their skates clinking a merry
tune.</p>

<p>At first they followed, as Ned had assured his
father they could, a “regular path,” made by the
skate-blades of numerous others. They met nobody
save three or four Hollanders from the island settlement;
odd-looking people on wooden skates, bound,
with easy, graceful motion, for town.</p>

<p>The tracks dwindled and dwindled, and presently
there were none at all. Not a person was in sight.
Before the three lay the vast expanse of ice, waiting
to be explored.</p>

<p>What had become of those reputed marks of Lou
Ravens and “Duke” Burke, the frozen river said
not, and the boys spent no time in searching.</p>

<p>Stillness reigned, broken only by the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
chopper’s ax echoing from the island, the cawing
of the black crows crossing overhead, the metallic
rhythm of the skate-blades, and the rumbling groans
of the ice as it cracked for miles under the grip of
the cold.</p>

<p>“My&mdash;isn’t this fine!” cried Hal, spurting to relieve
his spirits.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” agreed both his comrades,
spurting also.</p>

<p>For a quarter of a mile they fairly flew.</p>

<p>In spots the ice was so smooth that they flitted
over it with a velvety, rocking sensation; in others
it was of coarser grain, through which their steel
“zipped” only slightly less easily. In others it was
rough enough to make the blades clatter.</p>

<p>But all the time the trees and bushes of the shore
spun by as when viewed from the windows of a railroad
train.</p>

<p>Now the ice was black and clear so that in shoal
spots one could descry the sand beneath. Now it
was dense and milky. To glide suddenly from the
white ice upon the black was apt to give one a shock,
for the black looked like water.</p>

<p>Zigzagging upon their course, trying to select the
better ice, and ever keeping their eyes fixed before
them in order to avoid air-holes, the boys, at times
in close file and at times considerably separated, skated
at full speed.</p>

<p>Gradually they cut away from the island side, and
when they had reached the foot of Eagle they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
far out, toward the shore of the mainland, opposite.
Such a thing as slackening to rest never occurred to
them. The miles fell behind with no effort; in fact,
the pace was so blissful that the boys hardly cared to
break the charm by talking, and only risked an occasional,
“Isn’t <em>this</em> bully, though!” when they
skimmed across a particularly glossy patch.</p>

<p>With the island out of the road, here the river was
again a mile wide&mdash;a vast sheet of ice, with a few
narrow strips of sparkling blue which denoted areas
that never froze over.</p>

<p>The shore line bent inward, slightly, and looking
down the mighty curve the boys could already see
Newton, the clustered houses forming the background
to a sandy sprit.</p>

<p>“I’ll stump you not to stop once till we get there,”
challenged Hal to his companions.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tom. “I could keep this up
all day.”</p>

<p>“So could I,” asserted Ned, although his ankle,
not so strong as it was before the sprain, protested
that <em>it</em> couldn’t.</p>

<p>Ned ought to have supported it by a strap; but he
claimed that only girls and molly-coddles wore
straps.</p>

<p>Aiming straight for the village spire the three
dashed on as though they were dispatch bearers.
“Clink, clink, clink,” and the yellow dunes of the
shore danced past, and Newton steadily drew
nearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>A last glorious burst of speed, to prove how fresh
they were, and up to the Newton levee, fringed with
skaters, they dashed. Panting, running perspiration,
with a flourish and a scrape they halted.</p>

<p>“There!” they congratulated themselves, all together.</p>

<p>Thus they might go back home, and boast that
they had come those miles without a stop&mdash;for
although Tom had caught his toe in a crack and had
pitched headlong, even while sliding the fastest he
had regained his feet and continued his way.</p>

<p>They took off their skates, and went up town.
As they climbed the levee their feet felt very flat
and awkward, as is only natural when one has
changed from flying to walking. Ned’s ankle pained
him like sixty, but he minded it not.</p>

<p>There was not much to see in Newton. It had
only the single business street. However, they
sauntered here and there for an hour, feeling like
distinguished visitors.</p>

<p>“Let’s eat,” at length spoke Ned.</p>

<p>His proposal was instantly adopted. They recalled
a sign which stated “Oysters in All Styles”;
and presently they had clumped into a little back
room, and seated about a small round table were
waiting impatiently for “three stews.”</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;but this tastes good!” sighed Ned, when
they had drawn up their chairs, and the first spoonfuls
had gone down.</p>

<p>“Um-m-m-m-m!” mumbled his two companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>The stews disappeared; also, disappeared crackers
and butter and pickles and celery. None of the boys
ate pickles at home, but everything tastes good after
a fifteen mile skate!</p>

<p>They pushed back their chairs, and sat a moment
in silent contentment.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say to starting?” yawned
Hal, whom the warm soup and the close room were
making sleepy. “Then we can take it easy.”</p>

<p>So they arose, and stiffly passed out.</p>

<p>“You boys come down from Beaufort, didn’t ye?”
inquired the storekeeper, as each, with the air of a
millionaire, planked his quarter down upon the glass
cigar-case near the street door.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” responded Tom and Ned together.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, if you’re calculatin’ on skatin’ back I’d advise
ye to be settin’ off,” drawled the storekeeper.
“It’s gettin’ ready fer a big storm.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it will storm right away?” asked
Hal, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Can’t say; but she’s a comin’, all right enough,”
assured the storekeeper.</p>

<p>As soon as they were in the open air the boys
could perceive a great change in the atmosphere. The
sun no longer shone. Everything was gray, and the
wind was wailing.</p>

<p>It blew full from the north. When they had left
the levee, and were headed for home, it was exactly
in their teeth.</p>

<p>It was a gusty, mean wind; sweeping upon them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
with naught to interrupt it for miles and miles of ice,
it at times almost took them off their feet.</p>

<p>With heads down, and coats closely buttoned, they
stanchly pushed on.</p>

<p>Very different was this from the trip out.</p>

<p>“Whew!” gasped Tom, when they paused, after
having covered about a mile.</p>

<p>“We’ll do like the geese, when they fly,” proposed
Ned. “I’ll go first for fifteen minutes, and break the
wind, and then you fellows can take your turns.”</p>

<p>They started, this time in single file, with Ned
leading, and Tom next and Hal at the rear, all taking
short, choppy strokes together. At the end of fifteen
minutes, according to Hal’s watch&mdash;which his
father had given him instead of a gun&mdash;Ned dropped
back and Tom came to the front. Hal succeeded to
Tom, until it was Ned’s turn again.</p>

<p>This plan worked very well; in the unity of action,
the regular, unvarying stroke for stroke, was a certain
force that carried them forward famously.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour and a half Hal suddenly
called, from his place at the rear:</p>

<p>“Oh, fellows, stop a minute.”</p>

<p>Tom and Ned looked behind. There was Hal,
lying flat on the ice!</p>

<p>“I’ve got to rest,” he explained, as the wind
drifted them back upon him. Evidently he was the
weak one in the party.</p>

<p>“Get up,” commanded Ned. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>“You’ll get all
stiff.”</p>

<p>“I should say! You’ll feel worse than you did
before,” chimed in Tom.</p>

<p>But Hal only lay and puffed.</p>

<p>“It’s snowing!” exclaimed Ned. “Come on, Hal;
we’ve got to get home.”</p>

<p>Hard particles of snow were rushing with the wind,
cutting through the air and scudding along over the
ice.</p>

<p>Hal clambered to his feet, and the three lamely
started again. The stop had stiffened not only Hal,
but also the other two, and it required some effort to
limber up once more.</p>

<p>The snow increased, coming in blinding squalls.
The wind was keen and raw. The boys kept on as
before, now swinging their arms, now skating with
arms behind the back, and in other ways trying to
ease their labor by variety, until soon they were appealed
to by Hal to stop again.</p>

<p>“You needn’t lead any more, Hal,” said Ned.
“Need he, Tom? We can break the wind, and he
can keep behind.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Tom, stoutly.</p>

<p>But even then poor Hal needed frequent halts; he
was doing his best, only his best was not so good as
the best of the two others. Tom, also, began to be
in distress. As for Ned, his weak ankle burned like
fire.</p>

<p>The snow grew thicker, whirling out of the north,
and with a wall of white resisting their advance. The
ice was covered, so that their skate blades threw up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
little furrows. Now black ice and milk ice, rough
and smooth, looked alike, and over the air-holes was
spread a treacherous curtain.</p>

<p>“Come on, Hal! Don’t lie down!” urged Ned.</p>

<p>“I can’t. I’m tuckered!” gasped Hal. “You
fellows go ahead, and let me freeze.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t do any such thing,” declared Ned.
“I tell you&mdash;we’ll land on Eagle and walk up it as
far as we can. Walking will be a change.”</p>

<p>Tom said nothing, but his lips were white.</p>

<p>The foot of Eagle was still over a mile beyond;
how far they did not know, because they could not
see the shore on either hand. They were alone in a
trackless desert.</p>

<p>“You <em>must</em> come, Hal,” bade Ned, stooping and
raising him. “Tom and I’ll push you.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to freeze. That’s what Bob’s
howling meant!” moaned Hal, dismally.</p>

<p>But Ned and Tom each took an arm, and with
him between them valiantly struggled on. And it
<em>was</em> a struggle, with Ned doing most of the pushing,
and Tom having hard work to stand up for himself,
and Hal a dead weight.</p>

<p>After they had floundered on, in this way, with
pauses to catch breath, for seemingly a thousand
miles, the wooded end of Eagle showed darkly
through the driving storm.</p>

<p>“Hurrah. There it is, Hal!” cheered Ned.</p>

<p>His ankle had ceased to pain him; it had lapsed
from fire to an icy numbness. Now it kept turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
under him and his strokes were irregular and lacked
force. Tom, still thinking that he was helping Hal,
was walking on his skates, rather than skating. Ned
was the only one who talked. Hal was heart-sick,
and Tom was one of those chaps who simply press
their lips the tighter, and plod on until they drop.</p>

<p>Eagle approached, oh, so slowly. Risking the
danger of possibly thin ice close in shore, Ned,
pushing Hal, and with Tom stubbornly stumbling
along on the other side, strove for the point.</p>

<p>“There!” breathed Ned, as all three had done
before, at the Newton levee. This time, however,
he was the only one to say it.</p>

<p>They flopped down among the brittle bushes, for a
rest. It seemed good to be on land&mdash;bleak as the
spot was.</p>

<p>Presently Ned, arousing himself, kicked off his
skates, and while Tom was fumbling with his, removed
those of the passive Hal, also.</p>

<p>Ned stood up. Tom stood up. Hal tried, and
fell back.</p>

<p>“Hal, you must!” again ordered Ned. “Don’t
be a baby!”</p>

<p>“I’m <em>not</em> a baby!” sobbed Hal, stung to the quick,
and staggering to his feet.</p>

<p>Tom looked on, saying nothing.</p>

<p>Off they went. As they warmed to their work,
they found that walking was an agreeable change.
The wind was broken by the trees, and although it
wailed and roared, and the snow sifted in their faces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
still they were far more comfortable than they had
been upon the river.</p>

<p>Hal pluckily braced up, and would take no more
help. Tom made no sign either way. Ned sang
and whistled and joked, all by himself, and ever one
leg from the knee down was only a dead weight.
Sometimes he stole a glance at it to make sure that it
was there.</p>

<p>Eagle Island seemed deserted. In all their long,
dreary march, slipping, tripping, faint with hunger
and wet with snow and perspiration, they saw not
a house, nor heard, save Ned’s, a human voice.</p>

<p>When they reached the edge of the woods, they
found that they had cut across the island, and were
at the Paper-mill Slough.</p>

<p>Here Hal broke down again.</p>

<p>“You aren’t going to walk the slough, are you?”
he whimpered, seeing that Tom and Ned were hobbling
on, without swerving.</p>

<p>“Sure. Why not?” answered Ned. “We want
to get home, and that’s the quickest way, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid. The slough’s all full of air-holes!”
faltered Hal, beginning to cry afresh from weariness
and fear.</p>

<p>“We’ll go first, Hal,” comforted Ned. “You
aren’t afraid to follow in our tracks, are you? See&mdash;Tom’s
half way across already.”</p>

<p>For Tom had never paused, but had trudged ahead
like a machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-no,” said Hal, trying to be brave, and not
think of Bob’s howling.</p>

<p>It was dark. The slough was ghostly, and the
farther shore was but a dim line. Here and there a
light glimmered; northward were more lights, and
Beaufort.</p>

<p>A couple of miles, and they would be home.</p>

<p>Over the slough stumped Ned; behind him
trailed Hal, sobbing and moaning, but coming
on, just the same. It was no use for them to
pick their way. Air-hole and solid crust looked
alike. And while the ice cracked under them,
sending their hearts into their mouths, and the
wind lashed them and the snow blinded them,
they pushed forward and arrived in safety at the
mainland. Tom was waiting for them, like a statue.</p>

<p>South Beaufort did not interfere with them as they
toiled through it. Big Mike and the Conners and all
were housed from the blasts. As they gained their
own more familiar territory Hal blurted, suddenly:</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I was scared, fellows. But Bob
howled so like the dickens that I thought something
was going to happen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pish!” muttered Tom&mdash;the first time in
hours that he had spoken a word.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Ned. “Hal had more grit
than <em>any</em> of us, because he came ahead even though
he <em>was</em> scared.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller was half frantic, and even Mr. Miller,
sure as he was that Ned would “turn up,” was getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
restive, when Ned tramped upon the front porch
and in through the welcoming door.</p>

<p>“Oh, Neddie!” cried his mother.</p>

<p>“Don’t scold me. I’m so tired!” pleaded Ned,
now feeling free to give in.</p>

<p>He pitched into a chair before the sitting-room
stove, and they removed his cap and scarf and mittens,
and pulled off his boots. After he had swallowed
some warm supper, and had stammered his
tale, he stumbled to bed; and his ankle throbbed,
throbbed, throbbed, through all the night.</p>

<p>The next day he was on crutches again. Hal reported
as well as ever. It was Tom, the silent,
dogged Tom, who fared the worst, just as he had
said the least. For a month he was sick from the
strain and the exposure.</p>

<span class ="small">AN UNEXPECTED BAG</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Spring</span> came early, but none too early for the
majority of Beaufort people. In particular,
none too early for Ned, whose ankle was
proving a check on his farther winter sports; and
none too early for Tom, to whom Christmas had
brought a gun which he had hardly been able to use
even on rabbits; and none too early for Bob, who, as
has been said, was not a cold-weather dog.</p>

<p>With the advent of the south winds and the steady
dripping thaw, Ned’s ankle and Tom’s cough&mdash;keepsakes
from that memorable Newton trip&mdash;rapidly
disappeared; and the nearer ventured the ducks, the
stronger felt the two boys. Together&mdash;Tom no
longer Ned’s squire, but now, by virtue of that
Christmas present, become his brother-at-arms&mdash;they
haunted the levee, watching for the flight to set
in and the ice to go out.</p>

<p>Bob accompanied them. But he was not especially
interested in ducks. Dread of gun forbade
him to hunt them, alive; and instinct forbade him to
gnaw the bones of them, dead. Summer really was
Bob’s only unclouded season, for then he could share
in all Ned’s excursions. Still, even a dog cannot go
through life without trials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>All through the spring vacation that ice which had
made such good skating on the Mississippi hung and
hung, regardless of the fact that its mission had been
fulfilled, and that it ought to leave the field to the
hunters. Meanwhile the wild fowl had been making
use of the Missouri waterway; and when, at last, the
blockade in the Mississippi was lifted, and in the
shape of enormous floes of slush swept down the
channel, mashing against the piers of the Beaufort
bridge and piling up on the shores, the relief was too
late.</p>

<p>Most of the ducks had passed by, on another
route, and Ned and Tom had killed never a
one.</p>

<p>Tom was disappointed beyond measure. His new
gun yearned for its first duck, and but illy submitted
to the superior blood-record of Ned’s gun. Probably
this is why, in its mistaken zeal, it brought to bag
what it did.</p>

<p>The duck crop being a failure, the boys had to
content themselves with the snipe crop. After the
ducks, save now and then a wood-duck or a blue-winged
teal which had decided to stay all summer,
were beyond reach of even a thirteen-inch cannon,
not to speak of a twelve gauge single-barrel, jack
snipe and plover still lingered in the marshes and
along the edges of the streams.</p>

<p>It was the second Saturday in April, and Ned and
Tom were among the sloughs across the river, raking
the country for whatever might be so unlucky as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
offer itself as an acceptable target. The withdrawal
of the ice from the Mississippi had given release to
that in the sloughs, and everything was springlike
and green and watery.</p>

<p>Now it was afternoon. As to what the boys had
thus far secured, the less said, the better. Of course,
one cannot have good luck on every trip. But there
was a chance, yet, to round out the day well, had not
Tom’s gun, impatient and unruly, sailed in without
waiting, and on its own hook.</p>

<p>The slough was on the boys’ right. They were
walking single file&mdash;Ned carelessly a few paces ahead,
or Tom carelessly a few paces behind, just as critics
choose&mdash;on the alert for game. It might be a pair
of plover winging overhead, or a jack snipe whisking
from under their feet, or, possibly, a belated duck
squawking from its covert, or&mdash;something else.</p>

<p>“Boom!” And Ned was on his knees, and,
astonished, was trying not to fall farther.</p>

<p>It had happened so very suddenly. The first thing
that he knew, his ears had been deafened by a tremendous
crash, and at the same instant he had been
struck a violent blow on the back, and thrown forward.
The next thing that he knew, he was tottering
on his knees, and Tom was bending over him,
wailing:</p>

<p>“I’ve killed him, I’ve killed him! Oh, dear, what
shall I do!”</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t mean to, Tom,” comforted
Ned, still rather hazy as to just what had taken place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you dying, Ned? Don’t die! Oh, don’t
die!” pleaded Tom.</p>

<p>Ned examined himself, inwardly, a moment, to determine
what his exact state might be. He could
place no pain; but this was what seemed awful:
that he might be dreadfully wounded somewhere,
and yet not know it!</p>

<p>“Where did it hit me, Tom?” he asked, faintly,
and not daring to stir.</p>

<p>“I shot your shoulder all to pieces!” cried Tom,
wildly. “And my gun wasn’t even cocked!”</p>

<p>Ned fearfully looked over at his left shoulder. He
beheld his coat at that spot in tatters, and his whole
left sleeve torn so that it hung in only threads.</p>

<p>With such havoc made, surely there ought to be
pain; but on the contrary the sole sensation was a
curious numbness in his left side and extending to
his left elbow.</p>

<p>He wondered if it could be true that he was about
to die. He found himself not afraid, although it was
hard to die away off there, in the open country, beside
a slough. He was sorry for himself, and for his
father and mother, and for Tom. What would Bob
think? What would the boys and girls say? Poor
little Zu-zu would cry and cry, and keep his duck
wings forever.</p>

<p>“Can you move your arm? Try!” implored
Tom.</p>

<p>Ned cautiously tried, and found that he could
swing his arm and wiggle his fingers. But it was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
though he was experimenting with the arm of somebody
else.</p>

<p>Both were now becoming somewhat more hopeful.
Of the two, Tom, as was natural, was the more
excited and frightened, because upon his head rested
the accident, and because it was he who could view
the full extent of the damage.</p>

<p>Ned could only imagine; Tom could both see and
imagine.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’m shot so bad, after all,” mused
Ned, easing himself by settling back upon his heels.
“It doesn’t hurt a bit.”</p>

<p>“But you are! I’m afraid you are!” moaned
Tom, pitifully. “And it’s all my fault, though I
don’t see how it ever happened.”</p>

<p>From the appearance of that back it seemed to
Tom that the whole load must have entered Ned’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Isn’t any one in sight to help us?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>“Not a soul,” said Tom, with a quaver of despair
in his voice. “Shall I fix you as good as I can, and
then run like lightning and get a wagon, or something?”</p>

<p>“I bet I could walk as far as the road,” asserted
Ned, pondering. “That would be a better place to
leave me, for people are more apt to come along
there, you know.”</p>

<p>“But I hate to have you walk, Ned,” said Tom.
“It might not be right for you.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless he took Ned’s hand and helped him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
get on his feet&mdash;which was done with no apparent
harm.</p>

<p>“I don’t need to be held up,” objected Ned, as
Tom started to put an arm around his waist, and lead
him off. “You carry the guns. You weren’t going
to forget them, were you?”</p>

<p>Tom raised Ned’s gun from the spot where it had
dropped when Ned himself had dropped, and then
gave his own, lying where he had flung it, a kick.</p>

<p>“It can stay here and rust, for all of me,” he declared.
“I’ll never touch it again; never.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, you will, too,” scolded Ned. “Now you
pick it up.”</p>

<p>So Tom roughly picked it up. Together the two
boys&mdash;the injured and the sound&mdash;slowly walked
across the field, with Tom watching Ned askance, as
if expecting him to keel over at any instant.</p>

<p>Ned, however, while keeping himself well in hand,
and on the lookout for any new and warning symptoms,
did not feel the least discomfort from the
motion.</p>

<p>His shoulder was numb, and only numb.</p>

<p>To reach the road they had to cross a railway
track; and as they neared it Tom halted and cried,
joyfully:</p>

<p>“Listen!”</p>

<p>A clattering rumble, around the curve, fell upon
their ears.</p>

<p>“A train&mdash;it’s a train!” cried Tom. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>“You stay
here and I’ll go ahead and stop it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it won’t stop,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will. I’ll make it,” assured Tom, running
forward. “They wouldn’t go on and leave you here
to die!”</p>

<p>Uncertain as to how he would do it, but determined
to stop the train at all hazard, Tom flew for
the track.</p>

<p>Around the long curve swept the Pacific Coast
Limited, due in Beaufort at 3:21. The engineer,
peering ahead, was startled to see, planted between
the rails in the rapidly nearing distance, a boy with a
gun in each hand, threatening the advance of the
train.</p>

<p>The engineer opened the whistle valve, and the
engine sounded its angry, impatient command: “Out
of the way!”</p>

<p>Tom saw the white flare of steam, and a second
later heard the quick shriek of warning. But he
never budged. He only waved his arms and guns.</p>

<p>He tried to make the engineer know; now he
flourished the guns, and now he patted his left shoulder,
and now he pointed off toward Ned, and wept
aloud in his fear that he was not being understood.</p>

<p>The engineer and the fireman noted the gestures,
and saw that the boy stubbornly stood and budged
not.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a question of either slowing down
or running over him.</p>

<p>To Tom it was a question of either saving Ned or
being run over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The engineer’s hand tightened on the air-brake
lever. The other hand grudgingly jerked the throttle.</p>

<p>Tom saw the engine still closing in upon him at
relentless speed&mdash;and he only gestured the more.</p>

<p>Then, on a sudden, with grinding of wheels, and a
disgusted wheeze, the train stopped; the pilot of the
engine just touched his boot-legs.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, eh?” demanded the
engineer, savagely, leaning out of his window.</p>

<p>“A boy’s been shot! He’s got to be taken to
town right away,” explained Tom, hastening around
beside the cab, and looking up at the grimy face far
above him.</p>

<p>He clutched the cab steps imploringly, resolved
that the train should not start without him.</p>

<p>The fireman had jumped to the cab door and was
listening.</p>

<p>“Well, where is he?” demanded the engineer.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;&mdash;” began Tom, but he was interrupted
by a brakeman, who, followed by the conductor,
came running up from the foremost coach.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here?” asked the brakeman.</p>

<p>“A boy’s shot, and you’ve got to take him to
Beaufort,” announced Tom, again.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” snapped the conductor, now
taking hold of affairs.</p>

<p>“He’s coming. All right, Ned,” encouraged
Tom, beckoning to Ned, who was walking as fast as
he could, through the field, toward them.</p>

<p>“That him?” demanded the conductor, shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Tom. “He’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” ordered the conductor, turning on his
heel, to the engineer. “Young man, this is a dangerous
business you’re in&mdash;stopping limited trains
just for the fun of it. I’ve a mind to take you to
town and turn you over to the officers.”</p>

<p>He glared at Tom, and the brakeman glared at
Tom, and the fireman and engineer glared at Tom,
and all the faces stuck out of the windows of the line
of coaches glared at Tom.</p>

<p>The engineer reached for the throttle, and Tom
reached for the conductor’s coat-tail.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it’s true, it’s true!” cried Tom. “He <em>is</em>
shot. I shot him myself. You look at his shoulder
and you’ll see. Please wait! Please wait, just a second.
If it isn’t so, you can do anything to me you
like. See&mdash;how his left sleeve is all torn.”</p>

<p>“Have him hurry up, then,” said the conductor,
moved by Tom’s appeal, and able to see for himself
that evidently something was wrong with Ned.</p>

<p>Tom dropped his guns, and jumping down the
slight embankment sped to Ned, to help him pass a
barbed wire fence, and climb the gravelly slope.</p>

<p>“By Jinks&mdash;the boy <em>is</em> hurt!” observed the brakeman.</p>

<p>The conductor tapped with his foot impatiently.</p>

<p>“At any rate, he’s making us lose lots of time,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” he called, as Tom and Ned toiled up
to the track. And he added, kindly, as the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Ned’s pale face and tattered back impressed him:
“Get in the first coach, lad. Help him in, Jack.”</p>

<p>With a boost from the brakeman Ned safely landed
upon the vestibuled platform. At the same instant,
as though he had touched a concealed lever, the train
started, so eager was it to be again under way.</p>

<p>Ned, with Tom steadying him, entered the coach,
and sat meekly in the seat next to the door. The
conductor came to interview them, and curious passengers
crowded around; the news that “a boy has
been shot” had spread adown the long line of aisles.</p>

<p>Tom answered a multitude of questions; and Ned,
too, had his share. He told everybody, in reply to
their queries, that he felt all right, but in truth his
shoulder was beginning to throb and sting.</p>

<p>Presently a physician came through, and after a
keen look into Ned’s face, and a light fingering of
the arm and shoulder, pronounced no bones broken;
and being told that the victim was going only to
Beaufort gave it as his opinion that the wound should
wait, rather than be examined on the train.</p>

<p>Over the bridge rumbled the train; and in a moment
Ned and Tom, two forlorn figures, descended
at the depot.</p>

<p>Their car had stopped beyond the depot crowd,
and nobody noticed them emerge from the vestibule,
upon the bricks below. Tom, who had halted a
limited train, was equal to this next crisis.</p>

<p>The hacks and ’buses were at the other end of the
depot, but across the wide brick walk he saw Luke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Denee’s white horse and veteran express and transfer
wagon, with Luke himself standing by it, waiting for
whatever hauling the train might have brought him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Denee! Mr. Denee!” called Tom, running
forward. “Won’t you carry Ned Miller up
town&mdash;he’s been shot!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Luke, bustling forward.
“Ned Miller? Where is he&mdash;why, bless my soul!”
catching sight of Ned himself. “Who shot him?”</p>

<p>“I did. My gun went off by accident,” explained
Tom, wearily; he was growing tired of confessing it
so often. “He ought to be got to a doctor right
away.”</p>

<p>“You bet I’ll take him, and we’ll get him there in
a jiffy,” assured Luke. “Golly the grog and the
great horn spoon, Ned boy&mdash;did Tom take you for
a goose, or a snipe, or what?”</p>

<p>“A what, I guess,” replied Ned, as Luke helped
him into the rear of the wagon, and settled him upon
a trunk. The train was pulling out, and from every
window the passengers’ faces stared out upon them.</p>

<p>Barely waiting for Tom, with the two guns, to leap
into the wagon, Luke plumped upon the seat and lifting
the lines clucked vigorously to his white horse.
The report of Ned’s plight was now being repeated
from mouth to mouth through the depot and vicinity,
and as the wagon rolled away and turned down the
street it was followed by a murmur and many eyes.</p>

<p>With Ned sitting upon the trunk, and Tom standing
beside him to steady him, and Luke laying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
whip on his astonished steed, the wagon rattled down
the thoroughfare. Scenting something wrong, the
people whom it passed gazed after it in wonder.</p>

<p>“Where to? Which doctor?” asked Luke, over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Dr. Mathews&mdash;he’s the one the Millers use,” directed
Tom. “Is that all right, Ned?”</p>

<p>Ned nodded.</p>

<p>Dr. Mathews’ office was at his house, and luckily
they caught him in. Ned was wearing a hunting
coat, and an ordinary coat under it. The doctor put
him in a chair, and not saying “by your leave”
swiftly and skilfully cut away the layers of cloth, and
ripping up the shirt underneath laid bare the shoulder.</p>

<p>Tom, gazing, beheld a group of little round, blue
holes, and some smears of blood.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” he groaned. “Isn’t that awful!”</p>

<p>The doctor was delicately inserting a slender steel
probe into one of the holes. Ned, hunched over,
holding his breath and clenching his teeth, feared a
sorry time.</p>

<p>“Does it hurt you much?” asked the doctor,
gently exploring with the probe.</p>

<p>“N-n-no, it doesn’t,” replied Ned, relieved. He
could not feel the probe at all.</p>

<p>“Numb, eh?” remarked the doctor. “Well, that’s
good.”</p>

<p>“Is it very bad, doctor?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” assured the doctor, cheerfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>“Just a flesh wound, and in a week or so you’ll be as
well as ever! You’ve been struck by only&mdash;let’s see&mdash;ten,
eleven, thirteen&mdash;by thirteen shot, and they’re
on top of the shoulder-blade, every one of them, so
far as I can tell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad!” sighed Tom, bursting into
tears. Now that the worst was over, he collapsed.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Tom, old fellow,” begged Ned.
“Everything’s all right, now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” assured the doctor. “But you had
a very, very narrow escape. The load must have
passed between your shoulder and neck&mdash;and if it
had swerved a fraction of an inch to the right, or so
as to enter lower, you’d have bled to death long before
this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned!” exclaimed Tom, aghast at what might
have been.</p>

<p>“But it <em>didn’t</em> swerve, you know,” prompted Ned.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Miller, frightened as he never had been
frightened before, rushed in. Bad news travels fast.</p>

<p>“Ned!” he cried, at the sight of his son under the
probe.</p>

<p>“Now that will do, Mr. Miller,” cautioned the doctor,
smiling to quiet his fear. “Ned is right side up,
and almost ready for another hunt. He’s pretty
tough, you must understand.”</p>

<p>“Nothing serious?” questioned Mr. Miller.</p>

<p>“Not in the slightest,” asserted the doctor, with a
belittling shake of his head, and withdrawing the
probe from the last hole. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>“I’ll simply dress this
place with antiseptic, and you can take him home in
my carriage. Just have him keep quiet for a few
days, and I think that he’ll soon be as fit as a fiddle.”</p>

<p>So Ned was carried home in Doctor Mathews’
carriage, his father driving. Tom was left to bring
the guns, and answer queries along the way.</p>

<p>One would suppose that Mrs. Miller, by this time,
would have been so used to having Ned return after
having figured in some hair-breadth escape, that she
would take no especial notice of such a little thing as
thirteen shot in his left shoulder.</p>

<p>But when she witnessed him gingerly clamber
down upon the horse-block, his arm in a sling, she
acted as though this was his first, instead of maybe
his hundredth, accident.</p>

<p>Yet the thirteen shot in his shoulder did not
concern her so much as did the rest of the load,
that had passed so near, just missing his neck and
his lungs.</p>

<p>Bob followed Ned in from the gate, and sniffing
the antiseptic, and wondering why his master did
not respond, as usual, to his energetic greetings, remained
upon the front porch, to consider the new
smell, and ponder over what was up.</p>

<p>Ned’s wound did not trouble him much. He got
his hurts easily, as a rule, and just as easily he was
rid of them. Young blood is good blood for healing
purposes, as well as for purposes in general.</p>

<p>Tom was constant in his attentions, as were Zu-zu
and Mrs. Pearce. They sent or brought fruit and
books and everything that might benefit or amuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither of the boys could understand why Tom’s
gun had exploded, when it wasn’t cocked. However,
upon examining the cartridge it was found that
the cap bore a faint dot, where the plunger of the
gun had rested upon it. The cap had been too
sensitive, and a light jar had sent it off.</p>

<p>“Still, I’d no business to have it pointed toward
you,” asserted Tom, when Ned tried to excuse him.</p>

<p>“Tom says he guesses you’ll never want to go
hunting with him again,” said Zu-zu, one day, on
paying a visit to Ned. “He says <em>he’s</em> never going
again, either.”</p>

<p>“That’s all nonsense,” vowed Ned. “You tell
him so, Zu-zu. He’s the safest fellow in the world
to go with, now, he’ll be so mighty careful. My
folks think that way, too.”</p>

<p>When Zu-zu went home she carried in a little pill
box six shot that the doctor had cut out from just
beneath the skin of Ned’s back, where they had
come to the surface; and right and left she proudly
showed them among her friends.</p>

<p>Only one thing remains to note. Ten days after
the shooting, Mrs. Miller finally succeeded in tracing
to its source an unsavory odor that had been bothering
her, about the house, for some time. She
searched Ned’s ill-fated hunting coat, and with a
cry of disgust bore it, at arm’s length, into the
room where Ned, with the contented Bob beside
him, was sitting.</p>

<p>“What do you think I found?” she asked, thrusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in her hand, and drawing out, between her finger
tips, a mass of feathers.</p>

<p>“It’s a plover!” fairly shouted Ned, with a howl
of laughter. “That’s what I shot the day I was
hurt. I’d forgotten all about it. Ugh! Take it
away!”</p>

<p>“And Tom was so jealous that he shot <em>you</em>!”
retorted Mrs. Miller, hurrying out. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>“Well, his bag
was the biggest, I think.”</p>

<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">"Mrs.</span> Miller, can’t I take Ned fishing?”
asked Tom, through the open
door.</p>

<p>He and Ned and Bob were sitting on the front
porch. It was two weeks after the shooting accident,
and Ned, aside from the arm still carried, for safety,
in a sling, was apparently as hale as ever. Never a
day passed that Tom was not in to see him at least
once, and often more frequently, and visits from
Hal and other friends swelled the calling list.</p>

<p>Ned had told so many times just “how it felt” to
be shot, that now it was an old story, and he was
getting tired of being the fashion.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;&mdash;I hardly think it would be wise,
Tom,” responded Mrs. Miller, from within.</p>

<p>“But fishing’ll soon be over&mdash;that is, the best of
it,” pressed Tom. “Perch are running thick as
flies, so you can catch them as fast as you can throw
in and pull out. Hen Swiggert brought home a
hundred and four yesterday, and he was gone just
part of a day. It’s too bad Ned has got to miss the
fun.”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t hurt me a bit, mother,” urged Ned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>“’Twould do me good.”</p>

<p>“I think you ought to keep quiet,” declared his
mother.</p>

<p>“He can be just as quiet as he is here,” argued
Tom. “We’ll go over on Eagle. I’ll row him, and
we’ll get up in Catfish Slough, and all he’ll need do
will be sit in the shade and fish. He can fish with
one hand, easy.”</p>

<p>“Of course I can,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see what the doctor says about it,”
promised Mrs. Miller; and that was the best word
that the boys could squeeze out of her.</p>

<p>The doctor said: “Go ahead, but don’t get
heated.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a dandy doctor, though!” exclaimed
Ned, reporting to Tom.</p>

<p>“When I’m sick he’s the doctor <em>I</em> want! I’ll tell
my mother so,” answered Tom. “When a fellow’s
ready to go out he doesn’t keep him in!”</p>

<p>The boys had planned to use the scull-boat; but
unluckily it turned out that Hal wanted the craft
upon the same day as they, and Ned said, “All
right.”</p>

<p>“I should think Hal could let you have the boat,
considering you’re hurt,” hinted Tom. “Why can’t
he?”</p>

<p>“He and Orrie Lukes are going up the river and
stay all night,” explained Ned; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>“and they haven’t
any other boat they can sleep in very well. The
scull-boat’s dandy for sleeping in because it hasn’t
any seats.”</p>

<p>Which was true.</p>

<p>“We can hire a skiff from Commodore Jones, I
suppose, then,” said Tom, but in a tone not wholly
satisfied.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ll have to,” replied Ned. “We’ll get
the No. 19&mdash;she pulls the easiest of any. But I’d
rather have the scull-boat.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what!” exclaimed Tom, struck with an
idea which had popped into his brain. “We’ll get a
boat down at the Paper-mill Slough and then all we’ll
have to do will be to row across.”</p>

<p>“Whose boat?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Tom. “Anybody’s’ll
do. There are always a lot of skiffs tied
along shore there&mdash;old leaky things, but good
enough for us to fool with.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be stealing, would it?” asked Ned,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“No; I wouldn’t call that ‘stealing,’” asserted
Tom. “Some of them don’t belong to anybody,
’special. They’re just used by the South Beaufort
fellows to monkey in, and aren’t even locked. Nobody’ll
care a bit if we take one for a day, and bring
it back. It’ll save us a big row up against the current,
too.”</p>

<p>“Save <em>you</em>, you mean,” corrected Ned. “I can’t
row, except with one hand.”</p>

<p>“You shan’t row a stroke!” decided Tom, alarmed
lest Ned might be going to try. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>“I’m running
this shooting-match!” Then he added, doubtfully:
“Zu-zu wants to go.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take her,” urged Ned. “Of course! She
wouldn’t be in the way a bit.”</p>

<p>“Girls are a kind of bother, usually, out fishing,
but Zu-zu’s different from most of them,” said Tom,
highly pleased.</p>

<p>“Zu-zu’s got sense. She doesn’t just stand round
and squeal,” observed Ned, sagely.</p>

<p>“That’s right. I’ll say it, if she <em>is</em> my sister,”
agreed Tom.</p>

<p>Half-past five o’clock Saturday morning found the
four of them&mdash;Ned and Tom and Zu-zu and Bob&mdash;at
the Paper-mill Slough. Ned had under his sound
arm his and Tom’s jointed rods, while Zu-zu proudly
bore a slender little pole purchased for her by Tom,
on the previous evening. Tom was in charge of a
basket of lunch.</p>

<p>This basket vexed Zu-zu, who would have preferred
that each one carry a few slices of bread and
butter and sugar done up in a paper bag, just as the
boys did when they went alone. But her mother had
insisted upon the basket, with lunch in it for three.
Ned was to furnish nothing; he was guest of honor.</p>

<p>Bob carried himself.</p>

<p>The morning was ideal&mdash;dewy and balmy and
clear. Zu-zu, who rarely had been up so early
before, and who looked on this outing as the
greatest event of her life, was in the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
heaven of delight over everything; even Bob
could not keep back a few yelps; but Ned and
Tom, as befitted old hunters and fishers, used to
all hours and to all sights, were very matter-of-fact
and stoical.</p>

<p>Indeed, Ned had thought it quite out of keeping
with his dignity to have his mother arise before him,
and hover over him while he ate his early breakfast,
to make sure that he was well provided for and that
his shoulder was not troubling him!</p>

<p>The sun was half an hour high, and, peeping over
the trees of Eagle, opposite, was shining across the
smooth waterway. Fish were jumping, birds were
twittering, and the air was deliciously fresh.</p>

<p>With their noses resting upon the shore, and the
little ripples lapping against their sides, just below the
paper-mill there were, as Tom had predicted, quite a
number of skiffs, of various shapes and in various
stages of ruin. But, contrary to that which he had
predicted, all seemed to be padlocked, with chains,
to rings and staples.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty idea!” grumbled Tom, prying
along the line. “You’d think the old shebangs were
worth something!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it almost stealing, Ned?” inquired Zu-zu.
“Tom says it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“N-no,” replied Ned, weighing the pros and cons
of the matter. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>“You see, if we find a boat that’s unlocked
it’s a pretty sure sign that either it hasn’t an
owner, or else the owner doesn’t care if people
borrow it. We’re just going across the slough
in it.”</p>

<p>Zu-zu accepted the decision as final; Tom and
Ned ought to know. She looked on anxiously as
Tom examined the various fastenings. What if the
trip had to be given up!</p>

<p>Bob sat down near Ned, and whined. He wondered
why this fussing and delay. It was only a
short swim.</p>

<p>“Hurrah&mdash;here’s one that’s only tied,” announced
Tom.</p>

<p>“Goodie!” exclaimed Zu-zu, jumping up and
down.</p>

<p>Ned heaved a sigh of relief, and Bob pricked up
his ears.</p>

<p>“Come on, Zu-zu,” said Ned, descending to the
boat, at the bows of which Tom was fumbling.</p>

<p>The boat proved to be the worst of the lot. It
was a clumsy-looking, flat-bottomed affair, with
square ends, and unpainted.</p>

<p>“What are you going to row with?” asked Zu-zu,
stopping short.</p>

<p>Ned stared at Tom, and Tom stared at Ned. Somehow,
oars had not occurred to them, although had
they thought, they would have known that whatever
the boat, the oars would not be left in it.</p>

<p>“I’ll paddle with a board,” declared Tom. “You
get in while I’m hunting one.”</p>

<p>“Sit in the other end, Zu-zu,” bade Ned, holding
out his hand to help her as she sprang from seat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
seat. Bob was less polite. He rushed rudely past
her, as if afraid of being left, and planted himself in
the stern.</p>

<p>“Bob! Shame on you,” reproved Ned. “Don’t
you know that the rule is ‘ladies first’?”</p>

<p>“But that’s meant for men, not dogs, isn’t it, Bob?”
comforted Zu-zu, perching herself beside him, and
sitting on her feet to keep them out of the water
that swished about in the leaky craft.</p>

<p>Tom, with a piece of board in his hands, hurried
back, and when Ned had securely squatted upon a
seat in the middle, with a lusty heave he slowly
started the heavy boat from its mooring-place, and
tumbled in.</p>

<p>He stood up, and with a long, sweeping motion
paddled first on the one side and then on the other.
The craft, with its load, gradually crept toward the
shore of Eagle, a stone’s throw away. Zu-zu, fixed
in the spot assigned her, longed to trail her hand in
the water, but refrained. She did not dare so much
as move, lest she should become a “bother.”</p>

<p>Under Tom’s efforts they floated into the narrow
mouth of a little bayou, called Catfish Slough, which
wound through the island and emptied into Beaver
Lake, in the centre of the island.</p>

<p>“Gracious, but this is hard work!” spoke Tom,
after they had run aground several times in rounding
corners. “The old thing won’t answer her
helm.”</p>

<p>“Poor Tom,” cooed Zu-zu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s get out and walk,” proposed Ned. “It’ll
be quicker, and easier, too.”</p>

<p>Bob already was walking&mdash;or, rather, scampering.
According to his custom, as the boat approached the
land he had deserted.</p>

<p>“Let’s,” chimed in Zu-zu.</p>

<p>Tom swung the unwieldly craft in broadside
against the bank, where trees and bushes came clear
to the water’s edge, and all disembarked&mdash;although
by different methods. That is, Zu-zu skipped out,
Ned leaped out, and Tom merely stepped out,
so that he could stoop and tie the chain painter
to a root. Bob was present to welcome
them.</p>

<p>“There!” Tom said. “We’ve got here, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Nobody’ll take it, I guess,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Not if they have to row it,” asserted Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s the <em>Black Swan!</em>” cried Zu-zu, gazing back
upon it. “See? It has the name on the&mdash;the&mdash;well,
I don’t know whether you say stern or bow,
but it’s right under where I was sitting.”</p>

<p>“Huh! <em>Black Swan!</em>” commented Tom, in
scorn. “They ought to name it <em>Mud Turtle</em>.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to complain, Tom,” lectured
Zu-zu. “You might have had no boat at all.”</p>

<p>Then she suddenly closed her lips, and grew red,
for fear lest she might have said too much.</p>

<p>But Ned and Tom only laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>They walked ahead for a short distance, following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a path along the little bayou, until they came upon a
place where the bank was rather high, and the water
before it was unusually wide and deep.</p>

<p>“This will do, won’t it?” spoke Ned, who was in
advance, halting.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied Tom, also halting.</p>

<p>Zu-zu said nothing; she had faith in the two boys.
Bob dashed up and pausing an instant to catch the
drift of things, dashed off again. When he was in
the woods he was always very, very busy.</p>

<p>The bothersome basket, which nevertheless was
soon to make itself exceedingly agreeable, was
dropped at the foot of a tree; the boys fitted together
the joints of their rods, and Ned baited Zu-zu’s
hook for her, that she might be first to throw in.
Although he was limited to one arm, he could use
the fingers of both hands.</p>

<p>Presently Zu-zu was staring at her cork, bobbing
upon the ripples.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s under&mdash;it’s under!” she cried. “What
shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Pull it out, quick!” commanded Tom.</p>

<p>Thereupon Zu-zu gave a tremendous jerk, twitching
high into the air an astonished perch, which fell
back with a splash. The empty hook landed among
the bushes far behind.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! It got away!” complained Zu-zu.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t jerk so hard, Zu-zu,” advised Ned.
“Watch how we do it.”</p>

<p>At that instant his bobber, too, wavered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
ducked, and he cleverly lifted to land a fat yellow
perch.</p>

<p>“I’ve got one, too!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” laughed Ned, joyfully. “They’re
biting fine, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Poor things&mdash;just see how they flop,” said
Zu-zu, watching Ned string his spoil. “Do you
suppose it hurts them so very much?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe fish feel as much as we do, or they
wouldn’t have been made to be caught,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, please don’t handle them any rougher than
you can help,” begged Zu-zu; and plunged in
thought, she freed her line from the bushes, and
dropped it in the water again.</p>

<p>Nothing more happened to her cork, and after
guarding it for some time, while her companions
were pulling out fish right along, she hopped up,
and saying: “I shan’t fish any more; I’m going to
find Bob and look for flowers,” she tripped back into
the woods.</p>

<p>Ned lifted her hook and glanced at it.</p>

<p>“Why, your hook isn’t baited!” he called after
her. “No wonder you didn’t catch anything.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” answered Zu-zu. “I hate to see
them flop so.”</p>

<p>Ned baited it and let it down again.</p>

<p>“We’ll give you all that are caught on it, anyway,”
he said.</p>

<p>Each of the boys was fishing with three hooks
on a line; and the perch bit so boldly that often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
three were hauled out at a time, with others chasing
them clear to the surface, trying to take the worm
from their mouths.</p>

<p>Sometimes a round sunfish elbowed a perch out
of the road, and grabbed the bait, only to meet a
sudden fate.</p>

<p>Zu-zu’s pole and hook and line, attended to now
by Tom and now by Ned, added to the general collection&mdash;and
very nearly did more!</p>

<p>“Tom! Grab Zu’s pole&mdash;quick! I can’t!”
warned Ned, abruptly, himself engaged in safely
landing two large perch.</p>

<p>It was high time, indeed, that somebody came to
the rescue, for behold, Zu-zu’s cork was completely
out of sight, and her pole, pulled by an invisible
force, was sliding into the water!</p>

<p>“It’s a pickerel&mdash;it’s a big pickerel!” cried Tom.
“I saw his tail!”</p>

<p>He sprang for the pole&mdash;and at the very moment,
with a bound and a splash, that blundersome Bob
bolted into the water, from the other side, and made
for their spot, laying a course that would cut exactly
across Zu-zu’s line.</p>

<p>“Go back, Bob! Bob, go back!” ordered Ned,
furiously.</p>

<p>But Bob swerved not. He merely flirted the water
out of his ears, as if to say: “I don’t hear you,” and
ploughed on, barking his defiance.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickerel took alarm. Any fish might, with
Bob’s legs, working like the flappers of an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
turtle, bearing down upon him. He darted for cover.
The line grew taut&mdash;and then relaxed, limp and lifeless,
while the thrill all went out of the pole in Tom’s
eager hands.</p>

<p>“He broke the hook!” mourned Tom, hauling in.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob!” accused Ned.</p>

<p>Bob clambered up, shook himself, and hied into
the woods once more. The bayou was free for all,
and he saw no reason why he should not swim in it.
He certainly had to cross, some way.</p>

<p>“He was longer than my arm!” asserted Tom,
grieved, and gazing with regretful eyes at the worthless
shank dangling where the pickerel ought to have
been.</p>

<p>“Shucks!” muttered Ned; and his tone held a
world of vexation and disappointment.</p>

<p>Zu-zu came upon the scene. She heard the sad
tale without being in the least vexed.</p>

<p>“I don’t care a bit,” she said. “I’m glad the fish
got away. He didn’t want to die, I’m sure. And
we have lots of other fish, you know.”</p>

<p>It was plain to the boys that Zu-zu, being a girl,
could not understand what a truly great loss had been
suffered. So they did not argue the case.</p>

<p>As suddenly as they had commenced, the perch
stopped biting. The corks lay idly upon the surface.
The sun was high o’erhead. The dragon-flies shot
here and there over the water, and the gnats buzzed
around the fishermen’s ears, and the ears of Mistress
Zu-zu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s eat,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s eat,” wagged Bob, appearing as if by
magic.</p>

<p>The rest of the company being of the same mind,
the napkiny depths of the basket were laid bare&mdash;and
the way that basket heaped coals of fire upon the
heads of those who had despised it was a caution!</p>

<p>Fish bit only slowly during the remainder of the
day. One might have thought that they had worn
themselves out with their greedy efforts of the early
morning. Zu-zu and the two boys idled in the shade
on the turf, and Bob, tireless, roamed east, west, north
and south. If the island, formerly his home, recalled
any memories to his doggish mind, he showed no
will to sit and dream over them.</p>

<p>The shadows of the trees were long and pointed,
bridging the bayou, when the boys drew in the lines,
and unjointed the poles, and counted their fish.</p>

<p>“How many?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Fifty-three,” proclaimed Tom. “How many you
got?”</p>

<p>“Forty-two,” answered Ned. “You beat me.”</p>

<p>“But you had only one arm,” reminded Tom.</p>

<p>“Let’s see&mdash;fifty-three plus forty-two&mdash;that makes
ninety-five; and then there’s the big fish that got
away, which makes ninety-six!” exclaimed Zu-zu.
“My, what a lot! You ought to put some of them
back.”</p>

<p>“We’ve put the big pickerel back; that’s all we
can spare,” asserted Tom, ruefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>They retraced their steps of the morning, along
the path, until&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;where’s our boat?” cried Ned, astounded.</p>

<p>They had arrived at the spot where they had left
the <cite>Black Swan</cite>, but the craft had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Certain this is the place?” asked Tom. “Yes, it
must be,” he continued. “There’s the root I tied to.”</p>

<p>“Somebody came along and helped himself, that’s
all there is to it,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe it just floated off,” guessed Zu-zu.</p>

<p>“No, it couldn’t; or else it would have come our
way, with the current, you know, Zu-zu,” corrected
Tom. “I call that a downright mean trick, to take
our boat like this.”</p>

<p>“But we did the very same thing, ourselves. The
boat wasn’t ours in the first place,” retorted Zu-zu,
daringly.</p>

<p>“Well, the only thing to do is to follow on up the
slough, and if we don’t come across the boat we’ll
have to wait for somebody to take us over to the
paper-mill,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>They followed Catfish until they reached its head,
where it branched off from Paper-mill Slough. They
caught not a glimpse of the <cite>Black Swan</cite>. As they
reached the shore the Beaufort whistles were blowing
six o’clock. The sun was slipping behind a heavy
bank of clouds, and dusk was at hand. The three
could not make out a single person anywhere near
them, to succor them, and standing there upon the
muddy strand, with darkness closing in, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
nothing to eat and no place to sleep, they felt like
forlorn, shipwrecked sailors.</p>

<p>Bob, however, curled himself in a ball, and went
into a shivery doze.</p>

<p>“Here come some people,” announced Tom.</p>

<p>Through the mist now rising out of the water a
boat approached from the town side of the slough.
It carried a dozen Eagle Islanders who worked at the
sawmills, and were returning home for the night.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and ask them to take us over,” volunteered
Tom.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll go,” cried Ned. “They’ll listen quicker to
a fellow with one arm.”</p>

<p>The islanders landed some distance above the little
party, and tumbled out so quickly that by the time
Ned had arrived all but one had trudged into the
woods. This one was bending over, fastening the
boat.</p>

<p>“Hello,” hailed Ned. “Can’t you please take us
over the slough? We’ve lost our boat.”</p>

<p>But the man only grunted, and shook his head;
and picking up his dinner bucket and coat, and the
oars, stolidly tramped away.</p>

<p>Ned, indignant, examined the boat’s chain, with
the hot idea of using the craft, anyway; but he
found that it was padlocked.</p>

<p>He went back to his companions, who had been
eagerly watching, and reported.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, what shall we do?” wailed Zu-zu, beginning
to be dismal from the mist and the shadows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and the suspicion that everybody but them was going
to supper.</p>

<p>“We’ll yell like everything, and attract some one’s
attention on the other side,” proposed Ned.</p>

<p>“I’d swim and get a boat, if the water wasn’t so
cold,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Don’t try, Tom. You’d get a cramp,” begged
Zu-zu.</p>

<p>The boys shouted, and Zu-zu screamed, and all
waved their handkerchiefs, while Bob raised his head
in astonishment. Presently Tom panted:</p>

<p>“Somebody’s putting out in a boat, all right
enough. Keep it up.”</p>

<p>From the mainland opposite, where lights were beginning
to twinkle, a boat, barely seen against the
dark shore-line, was starting out into the slough.
They heard the rattle of the oars dropping into the
oar-locks.</p>

<p>“Keep yelling,” gasped Ned.</p>

<p>And they did, until it was plain that the boat was
making for them.</p>

<p>“It’s the <em>Black Swan</em>!” whispered Zu-zu, excitedly,
as the craft neared.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” scoffed Tom.</p>

<p>“But it is, it is!” insisted Zu-zu. “I know it is!”</p>

<p>And as it glided up through the muddy shallows
at their feet they saw that the <cite>Black Swan</cite> it was.
The rower stood up, and turned to face them. He
was Big Mike!</p>

<p>Bob growled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Want to go across?” asked Big Mike, with a
grin.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;that is, we’ve lost our boat,” stammered
Ned, awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Get in; I’ll take you,” offered the South Beauforter.</p>

<p>“Will you? Good for you!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” spoke Tom.</p>

<p>Zu-zu was too flabber-gasted by the sudden presence
of this arch ogre to say a word.</p>

<p>They marched in. Bob followed, with a dash to
get past his enemy in safety.</p>

<p>“Was it you folks that took this boat? I found
her up Catfish a little ways,” queried Big Mike, pushing
off.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes. You see, it was unlocked, and we
didn’t know it belonged to anybody especial, and we
wanted to get across,” explained Ned.</p>

<p>“It didn’t make no difference,” said Big Mike.
“If I’d knowed who had it I wouldn’t have cared.
Only, I thought some of them Dutch on the island
had got it. They’re all the time doin’ that.”</p>

<p>“Let me row,” urged Tom.</p>

<p>“Naw; she rows easy after she gets started,”
grunted Big Mike.</p>

<p>“It’s an awful nice boat. Did you name it?”
piped Zu-zu, timidly, hoping to please their dreadful
host. Who knows&mdash;he might be planning to dump
them in the slough, and drown them!</p>

<p>Big Mike wriggled uneasily, evidently flattered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Naw; she was named before I got her,” he answered.
“She ain’t very pretty, but she’s good
enough for ’round here.”</p>

<p>“How’s your shoulder?” he asked, gruffly, of
Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s about well. It wasn’t much, anyway,” responded
Ned.</p>

<p>They were half-way across, and the rest of the distance
was covered in silence, save when once Big
Mike remarked again gruffly: “Perch runnin’ thick,
ain’t they?” to which both boys assented.</p>

<p>“We’re much obliged, Mike,” spoke Ned, as they
rose to step out. “Aren’t we, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir-ee!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, ’twasn’t nothin’,” growled Big Mike, tying
the boat. “I jest heared somebody yellin’, an’
thought I’d go over an’ get ’em. I seen there was a
girl, and a feller with one arm done up.”</p>

<p>Ned whispered to Tom, and Tom nodded, and
with a gesture passed a string of fish to Zu-zu.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Zu-zu, holding out the string to Big
Mike.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> don’t want ’em,” declared Big Mike, straightening
after his task.</p>

<p>“But we ought to pay you for the use of the boat,”
said Zu-zu. “And for coming after us, too; and
we’ve got more fish than we can eat. There&mdash;you’ll
have to take them,” and she dropped them in a scaly
heap at his feet. Then the three of them hastened
up the bank, with Bob, glad to be free from the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of his foe, frisking ahead. Looking back, they
saw Big Mike slowly lift the fish, and, shouldering his
oars, start off, no doubt homeward.</p>

<p>“Big Mike’s not so bad, after all; is he?” asserted
Zu-zu.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Tom and Ned.</p>

<p>Bob did not join in this opinion. Nothing that
Big Mike would do could make up, in the mind of
Bob, for past offenses.</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="15">XV</abbr></a><br />

<span class = "small">JUST ABOUT BOB</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Bob</span> had now rounded into a fine, strong dog,
pleasing in manners and respectable in appearance.
At the time of his rescue from
the barn by Ned and Hal he was in his hobbledehoy
period&mdash;in dogs, as in boys, that awkward, sappy
state betwixt puppyhood and eye-teethhood. Out
of this he had grown up, under the good food and
kind treatment of the Miller household, into a dog
who was a credit to the family.</p>

<p>He was rather larger than a pointer should be,
with a head unusually wide and full, a sign of great
intelligence. His nose was a bit blunt; and this, and
his head, and his stubbornness, caused critics to hold
that somewhere in his ancestry was a strain of bulldog
blood.</p>

<p>His ears were thin and long and velvety, drooping
below his chops; his lips were loose and swaying,
and the skin of his neck was loose and wrinkly.
His eyes were a beautiful, faithful brown. His coat
was a rich mahogany, and was even and glossy. He
had a magnificent chest&mdash;broad, massive, with a bone
that jutted out like that of a turkey gobbler. Behind
it was a barrel of a body, which all of Mrs.
Miller’s stuffing never could make else but lean;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
while his ribs narrowed away until at his flanks they
ended in a sad hollow.</p>

<p>In truth, Bob’s front half was much superior to his
rear half, which ran off into a short, stubby tail
tipped with a warty knob. Whether some accident
had happened, to blight this tail in Bob’s infancy, or
whether his mother’s family had been so unexpectedly
large that there had not been material enough
for finishing Bob completely, no one could say. At
any rate, he was not fitted with a tail such as a dog
of his size and breed should have, and he was always
more or less conscious of the fact.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to Bob’s grin. When
he was tickled over anything his whole upper lip
curled back, exposing a row of shining white teeth
and brilliant red gums. Thus, grinning at one end
and wagging at the other, he tried to show his
pleasure. However, it was not a becoming face that
he made when he grinned, and many people, not
used to his oddity, mistook it for a snarl, and were
afraid. As soon as they came to know him, they
understood what a good-natured fellow he was.</p>

<p>Indeed, a more good-natured dog never lived.
Also, never lived a dog queerer and more human.
No one made his acquaintance but to like him, and
he was suffered to do things that would have earned
rebuke for any dog but him.</p>

<p>When Ned was absent at school, sometimes Bob
would become lonely, and would start out to find his
master. In manner unknown&mdash;but through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
nose, or ears, or eyes&mdash;he had discovered the room
in which Ned was caged during school hours, and
there, in his quest, he would betake himself.</p>

<p>If the door was open, in he would saunter, and
sniff down the aisle; and perhaps the first hint to
Ned of Bob’s presence would be that sturdy head
laid, amid titters, upon his knee.</p>

<p>As a rule Ned was asked by the teacher to escort
Bob to the door again. But occasionally Mr. Bob
would choose, rather, to climb into an empty seat,
and there, by quietly curling for sleep, make amends
for his intrusion. In this case he was allowed to
remain, and the room speedily forgot that he was
there.</p>

<p>At the stroke of the bell, Bob always promptly
arose and trotted out.</p>

<p>Whether or not he learned anything of mathematics
or physiology or grammar during his snooze may
be a mooted question; but Ned and friends claimed
that he did.</p>

<p>When it happened that Bob did not find Ned’s
seat occupied, he hopped into it, and there sat bolt
upright, as if to fill the vacancy, until Ned returned.
Once in a while he would refuse to get out&mdash;and
then would be hauled down by the collar, and led in
disgrace to the door.</p>

<p>With all the wisdom got in school, nevertheless
Bob did many foolish tricks. For instance, he
should have known better than to bury pancakes in
the fall, expecting to dig them up and eat them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the winter! When the pancakes were buried, they
and the ground were soft together; but when they
were sought again, a month or so later, they came
up&mdash;if at all&mdash;in flinty shreds scarcely to be told
from the dirt. Yet Bob seemed not to foresee this;
and even during winter thaws he persisted in scratching
small holes and placing in them buckwheat
cakes, for use in the future!</p>

<p>He so loved to bury things that his nose was
nearly always crowned with a little ridge of soil.
Once he brought home a five-pound roast of beef,
which a neighbor had got at the butcher’s with intent
to have it for dinner. Bob buried it in the garden,
and for a week and more regularly uncovered it, took
a few delicious gnaws, and covered it up again.</p>

<p>Ned was obliged to find the neighbor another
roast.</p>

<p>Bob was a dog not easily convinced. This is a
polite way of putting it, for the trait was neither
more nor less than downright stubbornness. When
he would not do a thing, he wouldn’t, until at last
persuaded by kind words, or hope of reward, or fear
of punishment.</p>

<p>Ned found that patience and gentle argument
were better than blows, to make Bob yield, so
threshings were dropped from the list of “persuaders.”
Bob had a keen sense of shame, and the tone of the
voice could make him feel worse than the hardest
licking.</p>

<p>His stubbornness was twice very nearly his death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
The first time, he was simply bound not to budge
one inch from the way of a heavy farm wagon. He
lay flat in the road, and waited for the wagon to
turn out for <em>him</em>. But the wagon kept upon its
route, and Bob, still sticking to his position, did
nothing but howl his protests as the wheels passed
over his back.</p>

<p>His bones being soft, he arose unhurt, and stalked
off in the sulks.</p>

<p>The second time had as a scene the approach to
the high trestle bridging a slough just beyond the
farther end of the river bridge. Ned and Bob had
been for a walk, and upon the return Bob had refused
to walk the trestle. According to his custom he
flopped down, like a spoiled child, on the spot.</p>

<p>Ned went ahead, hoping that at last Bob would
arise and follow. He had gone a short distance,
leaving Bob sprawled on the gravel in the middle
of the railroad track, when suddenly he heard the
rumble of a train, nearing from behind.</p>

<p>“Bob! Here, Bob! Here, Bob!” he called, running
back.</p>

<p>But Bob dumbly declined.</p>

<p>“Get up! Bob! Get up!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>Bob, with his master coming from one way and the
train coming from the other, stayed on his spot, deaf
to the appeals of the former and the warnings of the
latter.</p>

<p>The engine reached him first. Ned, horrified, saw
him hurled into the air, up, up, twenty feet, his legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
dangling and his ears flopping. Turning slow somersaults
down he came, clear of the trestle, into the
depths below. Ned caught a glimpse of the engineer
and fireman looking back from the cab and laughing,
which made him mad.</p>

<p>The first freeze of the fall had covered the slough
with an inch of ice. Down dropped Bob, as swiftly
as though he were from the dog-star, and lit squarely,
in a sitting position, on a shallow place.</p>

<p>The sound of a shrill yelp floated up to Ned, leaning
over to gaze. Bob bounced to his feet, and
leaving the outlines of his hind parts, with a hole
marking where his tail had bored, across the slough
he fled, his ki-yi’s drifting behind him, fainter and
fainter.</p>

<p>After much whistling Ned found him again, hiding
in the woods. In body Bob was uninjured, but
his feelings had been hurt; and for some time he
could not be made to believe but that a mean trick
had been played upon him by Ned and the train.</p>

<p>Finally he allowed himself to be coaxed upon the
trestle, and with whimper and trembling, with tail between
his legs and with many a backward glance, he
made the journey across.</p>

<p>Thereafter he took the trestle in a hurry, without
a sign of hesitation. He had learned a lesson.</p>

<p>Bob’s stubbornness was not always of mischief to
him. Sometimes it stood him in good stead, and
above all in his fights. Now, Bob was not willingly
a fighter. There were times when he would run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
from a dog not half his size. This lack of spirit was
a cause of great vexation to Ned, who, while he
would not have Bob a bully like some dogs, upon
the other hand would not have him a craven and a
coward.</p>

<p>But when cornered, or when once started, Bob
was a perfect demon at a fight. The dog that
picked upon him, thinking to be able to nag him
without return, was likely to have a sudden rush of
trouble.</p>

<p>Bob’s great jaws closed on him with a grip that
no struggles could break. When Bob bit, he bit for
keeps.</p>

<p>He had, in Beaufort, two particular enemies&mdash;almost
the sole enemies that he knew. Both were
white bulldogs; one lived down town in a drug
store, and the other lived behind a picket fence, out
toward the flats.</p>

<p>Up and down before this picket fence would race
Bob, and up and down behind it would race his
enemy, and between the pickets sped a thousand
names and epithets, the most stinging in dog language.</p>

<p>These were Bob’s moments of bravery; but let the
bulldog dart out at him, around a corner or through
a hole, and Bob would flee for dear life, with his foe
bellowing at his heels.</p>

<p>This state of affairs lasted for several months, until,
one day, Bob was surprised and crowded against a
high sidewalk, and obliged to make a stand. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
bulldog, after worrying him for a short space, on a
sudden found himself matched against a very angry
lion. Bob’s temper was roused. He outweighed
the bulldog, he outdid him in strength and agility,
and that canine had a sorry time before the people
who gathered could force Bob’s teeth to unclose
from a certain white fore-leg. As for Bob, the loose
skin about his throat had been all that the bulldog
could seize.</p>

<p>This bulldog’s day as an ogre was over. Henceforth
he was a wiser and more humble animal.</p>

<p>The drug store dog learned a like lesson in a like
way. One evening he cornered Bob in between some
dry goods boxes, and set about to have fun out of him.
The “fun” ended with Ned dancing around in dismay,
while a policeman, by the aid of lighted matches
and the handle of his club, induced Bob to let go!
Then the bulldog’s owner, crestfallen and wrathful,
carried his fallen champion home in his arms.</p>

<p>Bob proudly trotted on his way, licking his bloody
chops. His enemy was retired for a week, and
came forth again more discreet, and smelling of
arnica.</p>

<p>Yet, with all his victories, Bob never went around
with a chip on his shoulder. He much preferred
peace to war.</p>

<p>Bob’s greatest gift was swimming. The pointer
family is supposed not to like the water, especially,
save as a relief from the heat; but be it hot or cold,
Bob was ever ready for a plunge. His favorite fun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was to get out in the middle of the river, where the
current was deepest and swiftest, and swim up stream.
He would do this with no object, it seemed, except
showing off his powers in the water.</p>

<p>Ah, what a grand swimmer Bob was! With his
splendid fore-shoulders high and dry above the surface,
and his mighty chest throwing the waters aside
in a rolling wave, he would plough his path, regardless
of the distance, to the goal. If permitted, he
would swim for hours at a time&mdash;aimlessly paddling
hither and thither, chasing stray bits of wood and
even bubbles.</p>

<p>He would make a pretense at diving, but this consisted
simply in sticking his head under, and withdraw
it in a instant, coughing, and shaking the water
out of his ears.</p>

<p>Had he not been gun-shy he would have been an
ideal retriever for ducks. Indeed, Ned taught him to
retrieve sticks and balls, and other things thrown for
the purpose; and whether or not Bob had seen them
drop, by ranging in circles he always found them and
laid them at his master’s feet.</p>

<p>Ned also taught him to “charge.” Bob would
stay crouched against the walk or road until Ned or
Mr. Miller had gone on for a block, perhaps; his eyes
would be shining with eagerness, and his body fairly
quivering with excitement.</p>

<p>“Come on, Bob,” would sound the whistle.</p>

<p>One note was enough. Up would he leap, and
like a cannon-ball down would he streak, yapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
with glee at every jump. He never grew tired of this
game.</p>

<p>He would mind Ned or Mr. Miller&mdash;but upon Mrs.
Miller or Maggie, the girl, he used to impose dreadfully.
Let them try to stir him from the space that
he had chosen before the kitchen or dining-room
stove, and he would give a growl so gruff as to
frighten them into the distance again. They would
not catch the chuckle under the growl. However,
he never tried to fool Ned or Ned’s father. When
they said “Get up,” Bob got!</p>

<p>If he decided to accompany Mrs. Miller or Maggie,
he always managed to do it. They might send him
back, as they supposed, a dozen times; he only made
a short circuit, and sneaking along behind fences and
sidewalks would come out upon them, and grin. In
spite of their scolding, and the stones and sticks that
they tried to throw at him, he persevered, and had
his way.</p>

<p>He did not bamboozle the two other members of
the family. It was only the women upon whom he
played tricks. He knew that, with all their threats,
they could not bear to hurt him.</p>

<p>His bedroom was the barn loft, save when, in the
hottest weather, he moved down-stairs. His favorite
bed was a burrow in the hay; when a fresh load arrived,
Bob would dig and nose into it, until he had
made a long hole extending so far back that, in his
nest at the end of it, he was quite out of reach.</p>

<p>To Bob, Ned was the whole world. It offered no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
bliss that could equal the touch of Ned’s hand, and
no music that might equal the sound of Ned’s voice.
Just to be near Ned was joy enough for Bob, and if
allowed to snuggle at his master’s side he was in
ecstasy. A kind pat and an encouraging word was
all the reward that he wanted, no matter how hard
had been his task. Ned was at once his playmate
and his king, and life held nothing more.</p>

<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">One</span> o’clock in a morning of the last of May,
and the Miller household, all unconscious
of disaster, was soundly slumbering. Then
in amidst Ned’s dreams crept a dull series of noises,
which became a persistent pounding. Ned imagined
that he had dived under his scull-boat, and that the
other boys were hammering upon the hull, outside,
to bother him. He struggled to escape, but somehow
he seemed unable to get to the top again. This
is the way with dreams.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller, too, heard a pounding; only, he awakened
enough to know that it was a real pounding,
upon the front door, and was no dream.</p>

<p>He sprang from bed, and sticking his head out of
the window over the porch called:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter down there?”</p>

<p>“Are you folks all dead?” called back a man.
“Get up! Your barn’s afire!”</p>

<p>And Mr. Miller suddenly saw that the night around-about
was strangely lighted.</p>

<p>Ned was still striving to escape from under the
scull-boat, when he was brought to the surface in a
flash by his father’s commanding voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ned! Ned! The barn’s on fire!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” wailed Ned, striking the floor in a
heap.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, Ned,” encouraged his father. “And
dress as fast as you can.”</p>

<p>Trying to force his eyes open, and collect his
senses, Ned fumbled for his clothes. Now the night
in his room was turned to day by a glare of red light,
and he could see flames reflected in the mirror of his
bureau. In through the window floated a sharp
crackling.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” he groaned, again, his too-eager
hands making sad work of his dressing.</p>

<p>He heard his mother’s exclamations of alarm, and
his father’s replies to calm her; and without, echoed
the feet of running men, the cries: “Fire! Fire!
Fire!” and the doleful rise and fall of the water-works
whistle.</p>

<p>His father rushed heavily down the front stairs,
and the door slammed behind him.</p>

<p>Ned, his clothing only half fixed, instantly followed.
As he flew through the back hall he glimpsed Maggie,
wringing her hands, quite beside herself with
grief and fright.</p>

<p>“Oh, Neddie!” said his mother, whom he passed
at the head of the stairs, her hands filled with valuables.</p>

<p>He did not reply, but dashed down, and out of the
back door.</p>

<p>The whole west end of the barn, joining the wood-shed,
was blazing. His father was already attacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the sliding carriage-door (fastened from within), with
an ax, while a little group of spectators, anxious to
help, stood about him.</p>

<p>“Where’s the key to this?” demanded a man, who
was tugging at the padlock of the smaller single door.</p>

<p>“Under the step&mdash;I’ll find it!” gasped Ned, stooping
and groping in front of the sill.</p>

<p>The key had slipped into a crack, but he drew it
out, and put it to the padlock.</p>

<p>“Bob! Here, Bob! Here, Bob!” opening the
door, he shouted, up the loft stairs just before him.</p>

<p>At his words the flames and smoke sucked down
upon him, nearly stifling him.</p>

<p>“Bob! Here, Bob! Here, Bob!” he hallooed
again.</p>

<p>But no Bob. With a sob in his throat Ned sprang
across the threshold, only to be seized from behind
and dragged back, while the flames, disappointed,
licked after him into the outer air.</p>

<p>“You little fool&mdash;are you trying to kill yourself?”
roughly asked the man, holding him tight.</p>

<p>“But my dog’s in there!” cried Ned, straining to
break away. “Here, Bob! Here, Bob!” he called.</p>

<p>“He’s a goner, then,” declared the man. “Don’t
you see? The whole loft’s ablaze!”</p>

<p>“Y-y-yes, I see,” quavered Ned, growing limp with
a sense of the awful thing that had happened. Oh,
Bob, Bob, Bob!</p>

<p>He ceased his efforts to be free, and the man released
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Miller’s blows had splintered
a hole so that he was enabled to reach in and lift the
hook. The sliding door crashed open, and in
through the smoke he dashed, seized the buggy by
the rear axles, and dragged it into the yard. Its varnish
was blistering from the heat.</p>

<p>Time for rescuing anything else was not given. In
a fierce tide a torrent of blaze from the burning hay
above poured out between the warping boards, and
bending inward with the draft filled the doorway.
Through the barn, top to bottom, ravaged the fire-giant
with his flaming sword.</p>

<p>Still the water-works whistle was tooting and yodling,
but not a hose cart had arrived. The crowd
was growing rapidly, for the fire, fed by a ton of hay,
and a quantity of grain, was lighting up the vicinity
for blocks. There was a constant volley of queries
about the hose-companies, and a constant gazing
down street for some sign of their coming; Mr. Miller
was in despair; but no cart was yet on hand.</p>

<p>The kitchen gable was beginning to smoke. Ned
hurriedly coupled the garden hose to the faucet set
in the foundation of the house, and turned the nozzle
upon the scorching paint. The stream appeared
ridiculously small, and was bent and shattered by the
storm of inrushing air.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller crawled through a second-story window
above the kitchen roof, and hung a coverlet, hastily
jerked from a bed and soaked with water, over the
gable where the heat seemed worst. A line of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
was formed from the pump and from the kitchen
sink, up the back stairs, and passed buckets of water
out to him. These he emptied over the coverlet, and
here and there over the shingles.</p>

<p>Below, inside, were Maggie and Mrs. Miller, the
one naturally as strong as any man, the other nerved,
by the crisis, to unusual strength, standing at the
faucets of the sink and filling pails, pitchers, wash
pans, anything that might serve to supply the line of
men.</p>

<p>Outside, with the fire baking him, behind, and the
spray from the nozzle drenching him, in front, Ned
valiantly plied his stream. On a sudden it died
away to a mere trickle. The hose, under the increased
pressure put on by the water-works, had
burst.</p>

<p>Ned dropped the nozzle. At the same instant a
chorus of shouts arose, and a score of hands were upstretched,
pointing at a spot where, eight feet above
the kitchen roof, under the exposed gable-peak of
the main portion of the house a flicker of flame was
licking along.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller, bareheaded, his eyebrows and hair
singed by the waves of heat, from his position upon
the sloping roof of the kitchen, heard the cries of
warning, and saw the blaze which had passed his defenses,
and was in his rear. But in vain he dashed
water at it. Protected as it was by the overhanging
eaves, and occupying a place awkward for him to
reach, it resisted all his efforts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“Climb up with a rope!” yelled some voices.</p>

<p>“Get a ladder! A ladder’s the thing!” yelled
others.</p>

<p>But nobody seemed able to find rope or ladder, and
the flame continued to grow.</p>

<p>Ned shot through the kitchen and up the front
stairs. He bolted into his room&mdash;it was hot as a
furnace, poor little room!&mdash;and snatching his ball of
trot-line from the drawer where it had lain nearly a
year, bolted out again. He scrambled through the
open window of Mr. and Mrs. Miller’s bedchamber,
and running along the roof of the front porch shinned
up the water-spout and was upon the house-top. He
scaled the steep slant, and now, balanced astride the
peak, shuffled toward the farther end. The crowd
saw him, and cheered.</p>

<p>In a moment his astonished father beheld him
perched on the burning gable.</p>

<p>“Ned! Go down,” exclaimed Mr. Miller.</p>

<p>Ned wasted no time in arguing.</p>

<p>“Tie a bucket or something on this,” he called,
lowering his trot-line as he unwound it.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller grabbed a small tin pail which was just
being passed out to him, and fastened it to the
dangling cord. With the water splashing from it
Ned hauled it up, and the crowd of spectators
watched, breathless.</p>

<p>All he could do was to lean over as far as he dared
and dash its contents up under the eaves; a groan
from the watchers told him that he had done no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
good. Although attacked from above and below,
the tiny blaze lived on.</p>

<p>The fire had spread from the Miller barn westward,
and by means of the on-stretching sheds was eating
its way, rod by rod. The Millers’ next door neighbors,
on the west, were battling stoutly, with garden
hose and buckets, and the structures across the alley
had caught.</p>

<div class = "chapter">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i263.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class ="caption"><span class="smcap">All He could do was to lean over and dash the Water
under the Eaves.</span></p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These were low sheds, and not barns, so that the
houses were not apt to catch. The Miller house was
the only one that seemed doomed. Try as they
might, neither Ned nor his father nor other eager
helpers could put out that steady flame under the
eaves; and now the kitchen eaves, also, were smoking
and smouldering in a dozen places. The kitchen
roof was getting so slippery that Mr. Miller could
hardly move about on it.</p>

<p>“Clang! Clang! Clang!” The approach of
succor faintly fell on Ned’s ears. The hose-carts,
at last!</p>

<p>“The hose-carts! They’re coming now!” he
shouted to his father.</p>

<p>“The hose-carts! There come the hose-carts!”
murmured the crowd in swiftly increasing tones.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered Ned, scrambling back over
the roof to the porch.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” sighed Mr. Miller; and then he
could not refrain from adding, as he had a right to
do, the mild criticism: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>“And it’s about <em>time</em> they
came, too.”</p>

<p>Indeed it was. Down the dark street, shaded by
the trees, appeared four spots of light. “Clang!
Clang! Clang!” louder sounded the gongs&mdash;never
a more welcome sound. With tramp of feet and
hoarse shouts up raced the rival carts of the Pole
Star and Defiance companies, drawn by their
volunteers, and unreeling their hose as they came.</p>

<p>With a crash and a shower of sparks the loft of
the barn fell in, but there still was plenty of work for
the two floods that presently gushed from the fire
nozzles. Mr. Miller hastily ducked through the
window, and above his head spattered a heavy
stream before which the impudent blaze beneath
the main gable was blotted from existence. A driving
deluge swept against the kitchen, and all those
little flames that had been taxing the bucket brigade
vanished in a twinkling.</p>

<p>The house was saved; but seldom house had
more narrow escape!</p>

<p>Ned, climbing in again from the porch, had proceeded
to do something that long had been on his
mind. His loaded shotgun cartridges! Supposing
the house should burn and they should explode and
injure people! He had a vague notion that he
would be liable to arrest for having kept powder
around. Besides, he did not want anybody to be
hurt. So he groped his way into the attic, and
piling the shells in his arms carried them down and
laid them under the front steps. Then he breathed
easier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>He found that his care had been needless. The
house was out of danger, and already the fire, in its
march from shed to shed, had been met by the
nozzle-men and stayed in its tracks. Two streams
were playing on the barn, their water hissing among
the red-hot embers. Other hose companies had
arrived, and under the efforts the glare of a few
moments before had sunk to a fitful glimmer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller and Maggie turned from their labors
at the sink to the gasoline stove and made a huge
bucket of coffee. This they served to the chilled,
tired members of the bucket brigade, who were wet
with perspiration as well as with splashes from the
pails.</p>

<p>Ned now found time to recognize in the throng
of helpers and onlookers people from far and near.
The whole town was there&mdash;and had come, as the
funny costumes proved, in a great hurry.</p>

<p>Hal and Tom appeared in breathless haste, and
sought him out, and condoled with him.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Ned,” said Hal. “But I don’t believe
that even if the hose companies had got here
sooner they could have saved the barn. That hay
made an awful blaze.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they come sooner?” demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>“Why, they had the wrong signal,” explained
Tom. “They went ’way off in North Beaufort,
and then they saw the flames and turned ’round.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you save a thing?” asked Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just the buggy,” answered Ned, with a gulp as
heart-sickness rose in his throat.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” exclaimed the two boys, their
tones expressing much more of sympathy than the
mere words tell. Ned walked away, and they
kindly let him alone.</p>

<p>By twos and threes the crowd thinned out. There
was nothing now to see. Gradually, as the need for
their streams ceased, the lines of hose were wound on
their reels.</p>

<p>Darkness settled over the scene.</p>

<p>Before going to bed again the Millers had much to
do. While they themselves, with other fire-fighters,
had been busy in the rear of the house, a swarm of
eager townsmen had been invading the front part,
and lugging out everything movable upon which
they might lay hands. Chairs, books, sofa, pictures,
rugs,&mdash;all had been hurriedly borne across the street
and piled in a heap.</p>

<p>Even carpets had been pulled from the floors, and
bundled into the outer air.</p>

<p>On the top of the pile sat, as if on his own
quarter-deck, Commodore Jones. The commodore
might be styled as in undress uniform; slippers,
trousers, and a red bandanna to keep the night
damp from creeping down the neck of his nightshirt
forming his outer costume.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Mr. Miller, peering up at
him, through the dusk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only Jones. I was kinder keepin’ an
eye on these things o’ yourn,” wheezed the commodore,
carefully descending.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure we’re much obliged, commodore,”
said Mr. Miller, knowing the voice.</p>

<p>“You see,” exclaimed the commodore, “I looked
out o’ my winder, and I thought this whole end of
town must be burnin’. An’ after I’d got started, I
heared it was your barn an’ house, an’ I reckoned I’d
come on an’ lend a hand. An’ bein’ as I can’t stand
a wettin’ I thought I’d mount guard over your
truck, here. I’ve been burned out, myself, an’ I
know how more things are lost by bein’ stole an’
damaged than by the fire itself.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t necessary, quite, to carry out so much,”
observed Mr. Miller, surveying, as best he could, the
heap of goods.</p>

<p>“They was a leetle premature, that’s a fact,” agreed
the commodore. “It’s a pity you ain’t goin’ to
move; you’ve got a fine start at it.”</p>

<p>With the aid of the commodore and a few neighbors
the Millers placed their household furnishings
back under cover. Ned carried his cartridges indoors,
again. Mrs. Miller declared that she could
not sleep with her kitchen in such shape&mdash;the floor
one big puddle and streaked with mud&mdash;and she and
Maggie went at it with mop and broom. They not
only cleaned the floor, but also the porch and the
back stairs, which were wet from top to bottom with
the overflow from the pails and pans.</p>

<p>This done, the Miller household retired to resume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
its broken slumbers. But during the rest of the
night Ned, for his part, slumbered only by snatches,
now thinking that he smelled smoke from some fire
anew, and now thinking that he heard Bob appealing
to him. Several times he found his pillow wet with
tears, despite his efforts to shut them back.</p>

<p>At last he gave way, and blubbered well in
the dark, while he moaned: “Bob! Dear old
Bob!”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all the time in his breast was a faint
hope that perhaps, by hook or crook, Bob was living.
It did not seem possible that he should be
dead&mdash;gone forever.</p>

<p>However, in the morning the insurance men,
poking among the ruins, found him. He was in the
midst of the charred hay. The flames had scarcely
touched him, and Mr. Miller said that a painless death
by the thick smoke had come upon him in his burrow
without his ever waking.</p>

<p>Ned was glad to believe it, and was happier. He
took only one look at the still body of his faithful,
loyal chum, and walked away across the desolated
yard, scarred and marred by the midnight events.
He noted naught of this desolation without, for his
eyes were brimming, and within, around his heart,
reigned a greater desolation.</p>

<p>Later, where the horse’s stall had been, were found
four horseshoes&mdash;these, and nothing more. Yet the
fate of Fanny appeared to Ned as nothing, beside
the fate of Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>He went to school, as usual. Zu-zu came running
up to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned! Is Bob really dead?”</p>

<p>Ned nodded. Whereupon Zu-zu burst into tears
and fled up the school steps, into the shelter of the
hall.</p>

<p>Ned wished that for the moment he, too, were a
girl, so that <em>he</em> might act as he felt.</p>

<span class = "small">THE RAID THAT FAILED</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Wood-piling</span> time had come again. It
found a new barn and a new shed already
standing, in place of the old ones, upon
the Miller premises. The scorched house had been
repainted and the blistered buggy had been revarnished.
Thus far the damage by the fire had
been made good. But here the work must stop, for
no new Bob could fill the place of the old Bob.</p>

<p>Bob had long been put away; still Ned often
dreamed of him, and while knowing that such a
thing was impossible, was always expecting to meet
him, suddenly, around some corner. No other dog
would Ned have, although his father told him to get
whatever kind he chose. To Bob&mdash;faithful, human
Bob,&mdash;there could be no second.</p>

<p>The long vacation had begun, and Ned was making
his morning attack upon his eleven loads of slabs&mdash;that
annual visitation to which he was subjected&mdash;when
he heard a familiar whistle, answered it according
to the code, and presently saw Hal climb over
the alley fence.</p>

<p>“Hello,” greeted Hal. “Got to work?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ned, gloomily. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>“Just look at the
wood, will you!”</p>

<p>“Want to know something?” queried Hal&mdash;news
fairly sticking out all over him. “Well, listen here.
What do you suppose old Belton has got planted
’way off behind his house! Watermelons!”</p>

<p>He paused in order to give his audience time to
swallow the startling fact.</p>

<p>“Whereabouts?” asked Ned, delight in his tone.</p>

<p>“Near the ravine, beyond the grapes,” answered
Hal. “He thinks he has them hid, I guess; but I
ran slap into them yesterday when I was taking a
short cut to the creek. Come on, and I’ll show
you.”</p>

<p>“I can’t come now,” said Ned, slowly. “I’ve got
to pile wood till noon. But I’ll go with you right
away after dinner.”</p>

<p>“Well, you come around, then,” agreed Hal.</p>

<p>Squire Belton’s “place,” at the outskirts of the
town, was a standing challenge, for half the year, at
least, to the Beaufort youth. Of course, the squire
was only prudent in guarding his fruit as he did.
He grew fruit to sell, not to donate to greedy boys.
But they regarded him as a cantankerous, mean old
codger, and perfectly lawful prey.</p>

<p>It was very tantalizing to trudge along the dusty
road, on a day of late August, and to gaze helplessly
at those trees laden with their delicious, beckoning
apples! However, the squire’s big white house commanded
this orchard, and its windows were ever
staring, and the squire himself or some of his family
never failed to catch the least wavering from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
straight path of honesty&mdash;in this case the path outside
the orchard fence.</p>

<p>In addition, the barbed wires of the fence were
close together, and as tight as fiddle-strings&mdash;ugly
things to scale when the squire’s vigorous yellow dog
was coming full tilt.</p>

<p>There were grapes, too; and these were on the
slope, facing the house, and in plain sight from the
porch and sitting-room.</p>

<p>Orchard and vineyard stayed proof against nearly
all plots and attacks. But now, thanks to Hal’s
“short cut,” for two Beauforters, anyway, a new
field of action was opened.</p>

<p>Hurrah for the melon-patch!</p>

<p>His mind filled with the bright prospect, Ned gobbled
a hasty dinner, and made a bee-line for Hal’s
house.</p>

<p>Together they took their way to the limits of
town, and cunningly made a circuit of the Belton
premises until safe from those prying, alert windows
and the ever watchful yellow dog. Then Hal led his
companion into the ravine that pierced the squire’s
lands. Amidst a jungle of undergrowth they worked
a course, and when Hal gave the word warily mounted
the flank.</p>

<p>“There!” said Hal, when they had gained the crest.</p>

<p>In front of them lay a small, secluded area of low
vines, with every few feet a smooth, green oval
showing itself&mdash;peaceful promise of a fine feast to
come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t this luck!” whispered Hal.</p>

<p>“Say!” sighed Ned, overcome by his feelings.</p>

<p>Having surveyed, they beat a crafty retreat. So
very cautious were they, that on their way home
they scarce even dared discuss the find. It seemed
too good to be true, and might vanish.</p>

<p>That evening, when at supper Mr. Miller remarked
that an extraordinary crop of melons was in view,
Ned was so startled that he dropped his knife. Yet
his father’s words had no reference at all to Squire
Belton!</p>

<p>As the days passed Ned and Hal made regular visits
to the melon-patch. When speaking of the patch, so
careful were they that they always said “it,” and
by “it” each knew what the other meant. Thirty
yards was the nearest that they ventured to “it,”
since this was the space separating “it” from the
ravine. They kept their secret to themselves, deeming
that they could manage the raid&mdash;and the melons&mdash;without
help. Ned wanted to let Tom in, but Hal
thought that two was enough, and inasmuch as the
patch was his by reason of discovery, Ned could only
yield.</p>

<p>Week by week the melons swelled. The exact
time for making closer acquaintance with them
was hard to decide upon. The raid must not be
too early, and on the other hand there was danger
that it might be too late. Finally, Ned and Hal
could no longer stand it. Melons were beginning
to appear in market. The moment for action had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys chose a Tuesday night as the date for
the attack. Ned invited Hal over to spend the evening
at his house, and to sleep there. As this was
nothing out of the way, it drew no suspicion.</p>

<p>They retired early up-stairs, the better to talk.
They simply <em>had</em> to talk, or they would have exploded.
About ten o’clock, when the household
was quiet and abed, they climbed out of the window
of Ned’s room, scampered softly in their stockinged
feet across the sloping roof of the little side porch,
lowered themselves to the ground, hurriedly put on
their shoes, scurried for the back fence, vaulted it,
and at last were safely in the protecting alley.</p>

<p>There was no moon, and, old woodsmen though
they were, their way seemed to get all mixed up, full
of sticks and cans and holes and hillocks. Even in
the most open road they were continually stepping
on things that snapped or clattered, and they imagined
that the whole country around-about must be aroused
by the noise!</p>

<p>Faint in the distance, or near at hand, barked
dogs of farmyard and town-yard. An owl hooted
in an accusing tone, and Pete, Deacon Rogers’ venerable
clay-colored horse, from his pasture wheezed at
them through the misty blackness.</p>

<p>“What’s that!” exclaimed Hal, huskily, startled;
and Ned, too, jumped at the sound.</p>

<p>Had they not been setting out to “hook” melons,
they might have been braver. A nagging conscience
is a bad escort, especially on a dark night!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>They entered the ravine. What a ravine that
was! Not very kindly by day, by night it was
downright wicked! Every twig thrust up a finger
to trap their feet; every branch shot out a hand to
slap them in the face. And there was not a single
guide-post. Darkness had swallowed all landmarks,
and the boys could only guess.</p>

<p>When it seemed that they surely ought to be opposite
the proper spot, they climbed the steep
slope.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered Hal, beneath his breath, when
they reached the top. “We’ve just struck it! Here’s
the poplar we go by!”</p>

<p>“Sh!” hissed Ned.</p>

<p>As they crossed the thirty yards that lay between
them and the patch, how the weeds crackled under
their tread! At length they arrived at the fence
bordering the little field; formerly a fence with sagging,
swaying barbed wires betwixt which even the
most awkward person ought to slip without touching,
but just at present a demon of a fence which left a
stinging scratch along Ned’s back, and with a tearing
sound clutched Hal by the trousers.</p>

<p>“Jiminy!” exclaimed Hal.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” cautioned Ned.</p>

<p>And they were among the vines!</p>

<p>The only thing they could do was, carry off as
many melons as they were able&mdash;one under each arm&mdash;and
eat them. The chief reward would be the
glory of having got ahead of Squire Belton. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
mad he would be when he found, in the morning,
that he had been outwitted!</p>

<p>The boys groped about on the ground, with hands
and feet as happened to be most convenient. What
is apt to be the case, the fruit which they felt now
here, now there, did not quite suit them. They
fancied that a bit farther on they would come across
some better in quality. Since they could take only
a small quantity, they wanted it to be high in
quality.</p>

<p>So they proceeded, step by step, always in the
hope that they would light upon <em>the</em> melon, a melon
worth while.</p>

<p>“Cr-rash!”</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder!”</p>

<p>Hal had tripped on a vine, and had been sent
sprawling.</p>

<p>“Bow-wow-wow! Bow-wow-wow-wow! Bow!”</p>

<p>The Belton yellow dog! Nothing was left for
them but speedy flight. What a watchful animal
that was!</p>

<p>“Leg it!” ordered Ned.</p>

<p>At the instant of the accident to Hal, Ned had
been fingering a sphere of unusual fatness. Now
with a jerk he wrenched it from its stem, and hugging
it in his arms put his command into practice.
He “legged it.” So did Hal.</p>

<p>All sense of direction was lost to them; they remembered
not which was north or which was west;
their sole thought was to escape the attack of the yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
dog. Off to the left they dashed, dimly believing
that they were heading for the ravine.</p>

<p>“Look out for the barbed wire!” gasped Hal.</p>

<p>But they met with no fence, where they expected.
Crunch, crash, stumble and plunge, through the vines,
out from the vines, and into a clump of raspberry
bushes! Cracky! How those bushes punished
them! Yet on they ploughed, each for himself,
Ned clasping his melon, and the yellow dog yelping
in their wake.</p>

<p>Out from amidst the raspberries&mdash;and suddenly
Ned was hurled backward for a complete somersault!
A wire fence, fortunately not barbed, had caught
him fiercely, raising a huge welt across his chest and
another across his knees.</p>

<p>“Hurt you?” panted Hal, alarmed, bringing up
just in time.</p>

<p>“Not much,” panted Ned.</p>

<p>With a rush they overcame the fence. Their hope
lay in motion on and on, until that dog was safely
behind.</p>

<p>“Bow-wow-wow-wow! Wow! Wow-wow-wow!”</p>

<p>He was hard at their heels. Gallant old fellow, no
doubt he enjoyed many a hearty laugh over it all.</p>

<p>Hello! The vineyard! They had actually been
running <em>toward</em> the house, instead of away from it.
No wonder the dog was so excited.</p>

<p>Ned was a few feet in advance&mdash;a credit to his
fleetness, but not to his courage&mdash;and in trying to
tack and veer in a new direction he slipped, fell, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
rolled down the slope, staying not for stalk nor trellis,
clear to the bottom.</p>

<p>“And Jill (or Hal) came tumbling after!”</p>

<p>Still Ned clung to his precious melon, which by a
succession of miracles was yet unbroken!</p>

<p>With a thump they landed in the dry ditch that
cut along the foot of the vineyard. They vaulted the
board fence just beyond, noting, at the same moment,
that a light was glimmering in the upper story of the
Belton house. Evidently the dog’s clamor had been
heard.</p>

<p>The house was too close for comfort, but it gave them
their bearings. Only a stretch of level pasture now
remained between them and the road.</p>

<p>“Almost there! Keep going!” urged Ned.</p>

<p>“Bow-wow-wow! Bow-wow! Wow-wow! Wow!”
bellowed their pursuer.</p>

<p>They imagined that they could feel his hot breath
through the holes in their trousers. Hit or miss,
they scaled the final fence&mdash;this time a vicious barbed
wire thing which took tribute in the shape of both
cloth and flesh&mdash;and for dear life pattered down the
welcome road.</p>

<p>Towser’s voice became subdued by distance.
Looking over their shoulders they saw the flicker of
a lantern upon the squire’s front porch. They slackened
their pace to a rapid walk.</p>

<p>“Jiminy!” puffed Hal. “Didn’t we track it,
though! The dog couldn’t catch us!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a melon!” wheezed Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bully for you!” praised Hal. “Let’s feel.”</p>

<p>“It’s awful rough&mdash;it must be a musk-melon,” he
said, caressing it with eager fingers. “Smell it.”</p>

<p>Ned obeyed.</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t <em>smell</em> very musky,” he muttered,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I guess perhaps it’s a watermelon,” declared Hal.
“But either way it’s all right. What’s the matter
with eating it now? Nobody’ll follow us this
far.”</p>

<p>“That’s a go,” agreed Ned. “I’m dead tired,”
and at once turning aside, with a grunt of relief he
threw himself upon the grass by the hedge that
skirted the road.</p>

<p>Hal lost no time in copying his example.</p>

<p>Mellowed by the damp night air, from the scene
of the late hostilities floated to them the fitful voice
of the yellow dog, as he continued to tell his family
all about it. Of course he made out to them that
the boys were a band of determined robbers, whom
he had surprised and put to flight.</p>

<p>The moon, just rising, was shedding an uncertain
light over the landscape.</p>

<p>“Slice her open,” suggested Hal&mdash;referring to the
melon, not to the moon.</p>

<p>Already Ned was fumbling with a battered jack-knife,
trying to divide the prize in a scientific fashion,
so as to give each some of the heart.</p>

<p>It was a mighty tough rind. Could the melon be
green, after all! He worked as rapidly as he could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
considering the poor light, and the impatient remarks
of Hal, who was getting thirstier and thirstier.</p>

<p>Victory! He managed to stick his fingers in a
crack, and with a tug pulled the stubborn mass apart.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said, passing Hal a chunk.</p>

<p>He himself took the mate to it, and carried to his
mouth a handful of the spongy, stringy stuff.</p>

<p>The melon had not <em>felt</em> precisely right&mdash;and certainly
it did not <em>taste</em> precisely right!</p>

<p>“Faugh!” exclaimed Hal.</p>

<p>“Wa-a-a-a!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>How they sputtered! Their melon was a squash!</p>

<p>Words cannot express their disgust. They had
missed the melon-patch entirely. All that trouble
for only a squash! And now their chances had been
ruined. The squire would be on his guard.</p>

<p>“Come on&mdash;let’s go home,” blurted Ned; and the
two stiffly stood up. Stiffly it was, indeed, for their
spirits had been most effectually “squashed,” and
they began to be conscious of tokens of their recent
flight. They were drenched with dew. Every inch
of their bodies and faces and hands smarted and
ached from the briars and collisions with posts, wires,
sticks and stones. Their heads throbbed. They
were cold, hungry, and completely fagged. They
wished they were in bed.</p>

<p>Speaking scarcely another syllable they dragged
their heavy feet along the well-nigh endless mile of
homeward journey. As they entered the alley the
town clock chimed twelve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>They scrambled over the fence, shinned up the
porch&mdash;so tuckered that they did not care whether
or not they made any noise&mdash;and tumbled across the
bed. Such a soft, soothing bed as that was! Feebly
they started to undress as they lay, but they did no
more than kick off their shoes, and were asleep.</p>

<p>They slept like logs, until awakened by the rising-bell.
Quite in vain would they make themselves
respectable, although they tried their level best. All
their scrubbings and brushings and pinnings really
seemed to improve their appearance not one whit.
The raspberry bushes and the barbed wire had been
too thorough. Court-plaster, rather than pins, was
needed.</p>

<p>They were late to breakfast; and this enabled them
to escape the keen eyes of Ned’s father, who, having
been a boy, would <em>know</em>!</p>

<p>However, Mrs. Miller&mdash;thoughtful mother&mdash;was
waiting for them.</p>

<p>“Goodness, boys! What <em>have</em> you been up to?”
she cried, as they neared the table.</p>

<p>It might have been the scratches; it might have
been the clothes; probably it was both.</p>

<p>“Oh, we fell down,” answered Ned, sheepishly.</p>

<p>His mother scanned him sharply, but made no
farther remark; nevertheless, Ned suspected that the
end was not yet.</p>

<p>Squire Belton, or his yellow dog, must have talked
around town, so that certain fathers heard; and certain
mothers, having patched and darned some sadly-abused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
garments, must have exchanged notes, as
mothers will: at any rate, in a day or two the Miller
family&mdash;save Ned&mdash;had watermelon for dessert, but
Ned’s dessert was a huge piece of raw squash!</p>

<p>And Hal reported exactly the same treatment.</p>

<span class ="small">CHANGES</span></h2>


<p class = "cap"><span class = "upcase">Thus</span> passed the days in Beaufort; very good
days they were, too, taking them all in all.
But they could not go on forever; in human
experience nothing&mdash;not even eleven loads of wood&mdash;lasts
forever, and suddenly Ned found himself on the
brink of a change greater than his other greatest
one: the loss of Bob, now a year back.</p>

<p>For some time it had seemed to him that his father
and mother were sharing a secret between them, and
keeping him out in the cold. They would be talking,
and when he drew near they would stop, with a
glance from one to the other that said: “Look out!”
If he hung around for quite a while after he had made
them do this, he would be sent off on an errand; and
once his father had even said, frankly: “Ned, boy,
run away. Your mother and I want to talk about
something.”</p>

<p>The idea!</p>

<p>It could not be about Christmas, for Christmas
was eight months ahead. And it could not be about
his birthday, for his birthday had just been. And it
could not be about another dog, for he would not
have another dog&mdash;ever! Then what <em>was</em> it about?
He felt abused, as well as excited.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>

<p>“Ned, how would you like to leave Beaufort?”
asked his father, abruptly, one evening, at the supper-table.</p>

<p>“Leave Beaufort!” repeated Ned, astonished.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his mother. “Move away, you know.”</p>

<p>“For good? Where to?” demanded Ned, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, probably for good; not for bad, let us
hope,” replied his father, answering his first.</p>

<p>“To Chicago,” replied his mother, answering his
second.</p>

<p>“Will we take Maggie?” stammered Ned, with an
eye to the pantry supplies.</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but that isn’t the point,” said his
father&mdash;although Ned thought it a very important
point, indeed. “The point is, would you like
to go?”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to leave the river, and&mdash;and everything,”
faltered Ned.</p>

<p>“But you’ll have Lake Michigan, instead,” spoke
his mother.</p>

<p>“Tom and Hal and the other fellows won’t be
there,” objected Ned.</p>

<p>“They can come to see you,” explained his mother.
“And you’ll pick up lots of new friends. Why, the
parks are full of boys!”</p>

<p>“Having fun?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; baseball and all kinds of games, some that
you never saw,” assured his mother.</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any hunting, is there?” objected
Ned. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>“I want to hunt.”</p>

<p>“You can do your hunting when you come back
to Beaufort to visit,” proposed his father.</p>

<p>“Can I take the scull-boat?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>“No, I believe you had better leave that here,”
decided his father. “The lake has yachts, and steamers
running across, you know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Out of sight of land?” asked Ned, hopefully.
“Do they get wrecked?”</p>

<p>“W-well, not often,” said his father. “But they
<em>do</em> get out of sight of land, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>“When are we going to move?” demanded Ned,
now all ready to pack up.</p>

<p>“About the middle of next month,” replied his
father.</p>

<p>“Then I won’t have any wood to pile!” cried
Ned, overjoyed.</p>

<p>“No,” said his father, laughing. “I guess we
have enough to last us through.”</p>

<p>So they were really to move away from Beaufort!
This was the secret. Ned found out a lot of things
before supper was finished, and as soon as he could
he rushed out to tell. He went up to Hal’s&mdash;and
Hal was tremendously astounded. Hal and he went
over to Tom’s&mdash;and Tom was astounded tremendously.
And all three talked at once.</p>

<p>“My folks say I can have you up to visit me,
right away as soon as we get settled,” announced
Ned.</p>

<p>“I’ll come if I can,” agreed Hal.</p>

<p>“So will I, you bet,” agreed Tom. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>“I’ve never
been in Chicago&mdash;at least, since I was big enough to
remember.”</p>

<p>“You can have the whole scull-boat, now, Hal,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t want the whole of it. That wouldn’t
be fair. You can take it with you,” proposed
Hal.</p>

<p>“But I can’t take it&mdash;and that wouldn’t be fair,
either,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you! You give your half to Tom!”
cried Hal.</p>

<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed Ned. “Good idea, Hal!
You can have my share, Tom. I’ll make you a
present of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re fooling!” asserted Tom, staggered
at the thought of owning part of the famous
craft.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” retorted Ned. “You can have it,
truly you can.”</p>

<p>“Sa-a-ay!” gasped Tom. “I don’t know how I
can ever pay you back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!” scoffed Ned. “’Tisn’t anything.
Besides, Hal thought of it first. He’s the fellow to
thank.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “anyhow, whenever you come
around and want it you can have it again. I’ll just
keep it for you.”</p>

<p>The scull-boat being settled, the boys chattered
and planned about other things; and they talked as
fast and as excitedly as though Ned was leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
next day, instead of the next month. So much had
to be discussed and arranged.</p>

<p>That night, Ned dreamed that he came down to
breakfast and lo, his father told him to hurry, because
they were all packed and ready to start; and
there in the front yard was the scull-boat, heaped
with household goods, and waiting. His mother
and father and Maggie got in, and then when he followed
he had scarcely any room. Off moved the
scull-boat, down the street, with him trying to stick
on; and into the river it glided&mdash;and just across the
river, where the swimming-beach used to be, was
Chicago. Faster sped the boat, and now one of his
legs dangled in the water, and next both, and next
he was slipping, slipping, slipping, and with one last
despairing clutch he was left behind! He swam
after the boat as hard as he could, but his clothes
pulled him down, and nobody noticed him&mdash;until
suddenly dear old Bob was there in the water beside
him, and catching hold of Bob’s stiff tail he was
towed, at the rate of a mile a minute, back to Commodore
Jones’ fish-market.</p>

<p>But when he woke up, it wasn’t so!</p>

<p>The remaining weeks were busy ones for Ned.
He had so many things to do, as farewells. Strange
to say, all his friends envied him because he was
going, and he envied them because they were staying!
Only, he did not let on how he felt; it is
rather nice to be envied, you see! Yet deep in his
heart he wished that he might have a while longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
in Beaufort, where he knew everybody and where
there was so much fun.</p>

<p>At last his final trips down the river, and up the
river, and across the river, and to the flats, and
everywhere else, had been made. He had shaken
hands with Commodore Jones&mdash;who took pipe from
mouth long enough to say: “Well, good luck to
you, boy!”&mdash;and had patted the scull-boat&mdash;who
said nothing&mdash;good-bye for a space. At last all the
chores and errands of “moving” had been done.
The furniture had been stored, to be shipped later,
the house was bare and empty, and it was high
time they got out, for another family was waiting to
get in.</p>

<p>The Millers slept, that night, at a neighbor’s; and
in the morning they left.</p>

<p>Ah, how limp Ned felt, at going. Chicago could
not hold a candle, he was sure, to Beaufort&mdash;even
South Beaufort, where lurked Big Mike and Big
Mike’s “gang.”</p>

<p>Hal and Tom and Zu-zu were at the station to see
him off. Hal brought as a parting gift a knife with
six blades (better than even the knife which had been
lost among the Indian mounds), Tom a flaming red
silk handkerchief (a thing of beauty), and Zu-zu six
No. 8 shot (once they had been in Ned’s shoulder)
set in a watch-charm!</p>

<p>“You’ve all got to come and see me as quick
as we’re fixed; don’t you forget!” reminded
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will&mdash;and you’ve got to come and see us,
too!” they reminded, back.</p>

<p>Ned was hoping that something might be wrong
with the engine, so that the train could not start.
But alas!</p>

<p>“All abo-o-oard!” sang the conductor, watch in
hand.</p>

<p>“Clang, clang! Clang, clang!” warned the bell.
“Choo! Choo! Choo!” warned the exhaust. The
train began to move.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” called the friends&mdash;Mr. and Mrs.
Miller’s friends, as well as Ned’s, were on the platform&mdash;waving.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” called Ned, through the window,
waving in answer. “Good-bye, Hal! Good-bye,
Tom! Good-bye, Zu-zu!”</p>

<p>Across the bridge, over the river, rolled the train;
past the breakwater, where he had rescued Tom, and
above which was the swimming-beach; past the
slough, where he had been shot, and over which was
the trestle from which Bob had taken his amazing
flight; and on and on, into the country. Beaufort
and Beaufort people, Eagle Island, Deep Creek, and
all, were far behind.</p>

<p>“Just the same, I’m coming back every chance I
get!” vowed Ned, stoutly fighting to keep down the
tears.</p>

<p>“Of course you are!” said his mother, putting her
arm around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon Ned proceeded to make the most
gorgeous plans that ever were; and the best thing
about them is&mdash;that some of them came true!</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
